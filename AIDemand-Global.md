The graphs below represent my multi agent system created synopsis of what technology and skills are most in demand for ML in 2025.

This list is descending order frequency by volume of demand.

Below is a top 10 list for ML Learning - Topics deserving most study and research based on unique contributions of each organization contributing to 'state of art' evolution in ML.
Also if one organization is the center of activity for a given skill or technology advancement, I list the important URLs to learn more.

1. Python
2. High Performance Computing (HPC)
3. GPU/TPU/Hardware
4. ML/LLM/Transformers
5. Varies by org.  Nvidia & OpenAI: C++ & SQL. Anthropic: UI/React/JS.  Huggingface: Open Source Community.
6. Pytorch and Model Development.
7. Datasets, Databases and SQL.
8. Cloud platforms.  Top 3 in order for ML:  1. Azure, 2. AWS, 3. GCP
9. Linux/OS/MLOps.  Dockerfile to spin up replica instances.  Making it easy is SOTA.
10. 3D Computer Vision.

# Prompts to See SOTA Papers and Ideas in Code.

1. Python - Create a short python app.py and requirements.txt where requirements.txt has these libraries: streamlit, gradio, transformers, torch, andd huggingface_hub to create python library and wheel file package example to demonstrate a minimal ML model build using Python - https://pypi.org/).
2. HPC (High Performance Computing or Compute) - Create a python app.py, requirements.txt, gradio UI, and Dockerfile to deploy to azure container apps environment and configure KEDA to autoscale up  to 10 on web waits, and down to zero when not used for fifteen minutes.  Discuss patterns for coordinated load across replicas, Docker to Azure ACAE KEDA replicas using a azure container registry is most scalable pattern).  Create code to add the azure resources required.
3. GPU/TPU/Hardware (Get a GPU or use HF Zero, learn CUDA.  https://developer.nvidia.com/, https://huggingface.co/GPUModelSpotlight) demonstrate in python app.py, gradio UI and requirements.txt detection and display of CUDA properties to ddetect devicce or hardware capabilities using python and then demonstrate the performance differencce in python to do an automated benchmark visually for your GPU.
4. ML/LLM/Transformers (Huggingface python library Transformers is used by everyone and the cornerstone of LLMs/GAI - https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index), Create several app.py functions and a gradio UI for testing the main functions in the transformers library.
5. When you put together roles in an organization simulated as agents, you would want to generate code of three varieties: 1. Python for wrapping C++ cuda library functions, 2. SQL and JSON queries for NOSQL demonstrating KM by database using azure cosmosdb as an example.  3. Open source model building which includes the MIT license or Apache license and show differences and instrucctions for building python wheel files to distribute libraries but not code.  Also demonstrate the huggingface_hub library functions.  Use gradio as UI library and show app.py and requirements.txt. For position 5 demand varies dramatically by org.  This one I subdivide to explain differences between organizations.
  1. Nvidia and OpenAI both have languages C++, and SQL.  These are frontrunners still due to HPC patterns for massive datasets and compute jobs.
  2. Anthropic next favors the React/Javascript/JS pattern and Artifacts and Computer Use in Claude set the SOTA.  This pattern can also be used direct from python libraries surprisingly (streamlit has good support for reactive componentns)
  3. Huggingface favors Open Source contribution and Community Engagement.  They are setting hardware independent patterns and have the worlds largest model and dataset hub with huggingface spaces.
6. Pytorch and Model Development.  Two main python libraries are at the heart of ML:  Torch and Tensorflow.  All four orgs favor Pytorch.  Write a demo program app.py for comparison of each in a single streamlit app.py and requirements.txt using streamlit or gradio for the UI and model interactions.
7. Datasets, Databases and SQL - ML starts with datasets.  ML models are direct descendants of datasets chosen and ML won't know what isn't in input datasets.  Show building a small model from an uploaded dataset and show user what input should look like as a template.  Then create interactive app.py and requirements.txt using gradio or streamlit UI to generate a short dataset, and use it to create a model.  Show concepts of distillation techniques in the build.
8. Cloud platforms.  Each have advantages, disadvantages and cost differences.  Top 3 in order for ML:  1. Azure, 2. AWS, 3. GCP  Write a short code demonstration on how to interact with python libraries from each and list all python libraries associated with the cloud type.
9. Linux/OS/MLOps.  State of art is to use Dockerfile to spin up replica instances.  Making it easy is SOTA.  Huggingface open source and platform are easiest and cheapest at scale for Global audience.  Replicate is #2.
10. 3D Computer Vision.  This one only Hugginface and NVIDIA have an edge with.  DeepRL patterns (Unity, OpenAI's gym, Nvidia's Magic3D and Omniverse blaze the trail.  Create an app.py and requirements.txt that uses torch and transformers to take a png image file as input and output a 3d model of an extrude done on pixel brightness.  Also if the pixel color is black, weld the model with a flat plane so black is transparent.  Output as glb or obj download and use gradio or stremamlit UI.
