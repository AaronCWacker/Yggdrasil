The graphs below represent my multi agent system created synopsis of what technology and skills are most in demand for ML in 2025.

This list is descending order frequency by volume of demand.

Below is a top 10 list for ML Learning - Topics deserving most study and research based on unique contributions of each organization contributing to 'state of art' evolution in ML.
Also if one organization is the center of activity for a given skill or technology advancement, I list the important URLs to learn more.

1. Python
2. High Performance Computing (HPC)
3. GPU/TPU/Hardware
4. ML/LLM/Transformers
5. Varies by org.  Nvidia & OpenAI: C++ & SQL. Anthropic: UI/React/JS.  Huggingface: Open Source Community.
6. Pytorch and Model Development.
7. Datasets, Databases and SQL.
8. Cloud platforms.  Top 3 in order for ML:  1. Azure, 2. AWS, 3. GCP
9. Linux/OS/MLOps.  Dockerfile to spin up replica instances.  Making it easy is SOTA.
10. 3D Computer Vision.

# Prompts to See SOTA Papers and Ideas in Code.

1. Python - Create a short python app.py and requirements.txt where requirements.txt has these libraries: streamlit, gradio, transformers, torch, andd huggingface_hub to create python library and wheel file package example to demonstrate a minimal ML model build using Python - https://pypi.org/).
2. HPC (High Performance Computing or Compute) - Create a python app.py, requirements.txt, gradio UI, and Dockerfile to deploy to azure container apps environment and configure KEDA to autoscale up  to 10 on web waits, and down to zero when not used for fifteen minutes.  Discuss patterns for coordinated load across replicas, Docker to Azure ACAE KEDA replicas using a azure container registry is most scalable pattern).  Create code to add the azure resources required.
3. GPU/TPU/Hardware (Get a GPU or use HF Zero, learn CUDA.  https://developer.nvidia.com/, https://huggingface.co/GPUModelSpotlight) demonstrate in python app.py, gradio UI and requirements.txt detection and display of CUDA properties to ddetect devicce or hardware capabilities using python and then demonstrate the performance differencce in python to do an automated benchmark visually for your GPU.
4. ML/LLM/Transformers (Huggingface python library Transformers is used by everyone and the cornerstone of LLMs/GAI - https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index), Create several app.py functions and a gradio UI for testing the main functions in the transformers library.
5. When you put together roles in an organization simulated as agents, you would want to generate code of three varieties: 1. Python for wrapping C++ cuda library functions, 2. SQL and JSON queries for NOSQL demonstrating KM by database using azure cosmosdb as an example.  3. Open source model building which includes the MIT license or Apache license and show differences and instrucctions for building python wheel files to distribute libraries but not code.  Also demonstrate the huggingface_hub library functions.  Use gradio as UI library and show app.py and requirements.txt. For position 5 demand varies dramatically by org.  This one I subdivide to explain differences between organizations.
  1. Nvidia and OpenAI both have languages C++, and SQL.  These are frontrunners still due to HPC patterns for massive datasets and compute jobs.
  2. Anthropic next favors the React/Javascript/JS pattern and Artifacts and Computer Use in Claude set the SOTA.  This pattern can also be used direct from python libraries surprisingly (streamlit has good support for reactive componentns)
  3. Huggingface favors Open Source contribution and Community Engagement.  They are setting hardware independent patterns and have the worlds largest model and dataset hub with huggingface spaces.
6. Pytorch and Model Development.  Two main python libraries are at the heart of ML:  Torch and Tensorflow.  All four orgs favor Pytorch.  Write a demo program app.py for comparison of each in a single streamlit app.py and requirements.txt using streamlit or gradio for the UI and model interactions.
7. Datasets, Databases and SQL - ML starts with datasets.  ML models are direct descendants of datasets chosen and ML won't know what isn't in input datasets.  Show building a small model from an uploaded dataset and show user what input should look like as a template.  Then create interactive app.py and requirements.txt using gradio or streamlit UI to generate a short dataset, and use it to create a model.  Show concepts of distillation techniques in the build.
8. Cloud platforms.  Each have advantages, disadvantages and cost differences.  Top 3 in order for ML:  1. Azure, 2. AWS, 3. GCP  Write a short code demonstration on how to interact with python libraries from each and list all python libraries associated with the cloud type.
9. Linux/OS/MLOps.  State of art is to use Dockerfile to spin up replica instances.  Making it easy is SOTA.  Huggingface open source and platform are easiest and cheapest at scale for Global audience.  Replicate is #2.
10. 3D Computer Vision.  This one only Hugginface and NVIDIA have an edge with.  DeepRL patterns (Unity, OpenAI's gym, Nvidia's Magic3D and Omniverse blaze the trail.  Create an app.py and requirements.txt that uses torch and transformers to take a png image file as input and output a 3d model of an extrude done on pixel brightness.  Also if the pixel color is black, weld the model with a flat plane so black is transparent.  Output as glb or obj download and use gradio or stremamlit UI.






# Move 37

I had a move 37 moment with o3-mini-high since it was able to figure out a cross platform async issue in python for HPC scaling patterns.

Here is the move (in python code):
# Patch the asyncio event loop to allow nested use of asyncio.run()
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()

📄 Efficient MPI-based Communication for GPU-Accelerated Dask Applications
### 21 Jan 2021 | Efficient MPI-based Communication for GPU-Accelerated Dask Applications — Arxiv Link)

PDF Link: PDF.pdf)

Authors: Aamir Shafi, Jahanzeb Maqbool Hashmi, Hari Subramoni and Dhabaleswar K. Panda

Dask is a popular parallel and distributed computing framework, which rivals Apache Spark to enable task-based scalable processing of big data. The Dask Distributed library forms the basis of this computing engine and provides support for adding new communication devices. It currently has two communication devices: one for TCP and the other for high-speed networks using UCX-Py — a Cython wrapper to UCX. This paper presents the design and implementation of a new communication backend for Dask — called MPI4Dask — that is targeted for modern HPC clusters built with GPUs. MPI4Dask exploits mpi4py over MVAPICH2-GDR, which is a GPU-aware implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard. MPI4Dask provides point-to-point asynchronous I/O communication coroutines, which are non-blocking concurrent operations defined using the async/await keywords from the Python's asyncio framework. Our latency and throughput comparisons suggest that MPI4Dask outperforms UCX by 6x for 1 Byte message and 4x for large messages (2 MBytes and beyond) respectively. We also conduct comparative performance evaluation of MPI4Dask with UCX using two benchmark applications: 1) sum of cuPy array with its transpose, and 2) cuDF merge. MPI4Dask speeds up the overall execution time of the two applications by an average of 3.47x and 3.11x respectively on an in-house cluster built with NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs for 1-6 Dask workers. We also perform scalability analysis of MPI4Dask against UCX for these applications on TACC's Frontera (GPU) system with upto 32 Dask workers on 32 NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000 GPUs and 256 CPU cores. MPI4Dask speeds up the execution time for cuPy and cuDF applications by an average of 1.71x and 2.91x respectively for 1-32 Dask workers on the Frontera (GPU) system. ---------------

Mapping the flow
Creating an integrated model

The user seeks to generate a comprehensive mermaid model from the consolidated 20 mermaid models, merging key terms to illustrate asynchronous high-performance scaling patterns in async Python code combined with web async code.

Crafting a cohesive diagram

I'm pulling together a single mermaid diagram, featuring HPC terms, distributed frameworks, and asynchronous patterns, to show their interconnections and relationships.

Organizing connections

I'm mapping out key terms such as "MPI4Dask," "Dask," "UCX," and "python" to show the interrelationships among HPC frameworks, Python code, and asynchronous patterns in a clear hierarchy.

Crafting the flowchart

Piecing together a comprehensive flowchart, I’m highlighting "Asynchronous HPC Scaling Patterns" and branching out to HPC frameworks and hardware references to elucidate their interconnections.

Mapping out the hierarchy

I’m organizing HPC frameworks and Python code, distinctively separating hardware references and various HPC patterns like "Asynchronous," "Parallel," and "Distributed" into a structured flowchart.

Formulating a hierarchy

I’m piecing together a single flowchart with "Asynchronous HPC Patterns for Python & Web" as the root node. This node will branch into HPC frameworks, hardware references, and patterns, keeping the structure clear and organized.

Choosing the path

I’m considering a single, large flowchart to map out the intricacies of HPC frameworks, codes, and patterns, aiming for a comprehensive yet organized visual representation.

Mapping the flow
