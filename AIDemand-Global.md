The graphs below represent my multi agent system created synopsis of what technology and skills are most in demand for ML in 2025.

This list is descending order frequency by volume of demand.

1. NVIDIA - ML originates with HPC and GPU/TPU/Hardware

2. OpenAI - Python, HPC, and LLMs/Generative AI with Transformers.

3. Anthropic - Python, Kubernetes/K8s (KEDA for HPC!), GPU/TPU/Hardware

Below is a top 10 list for ML Learning - Topics deserving most study and research based on unique contributions of each organization contributing to 'state of art' evolution in ML.

Also if one organization is the center of activity for a given skill or technology advancement, I list the important URLs to learn more.


1. Python (Create wheel files, python libraries and refactor all apps to Python - https://pypi.org/)
2. HPC (High Performance Computing or Compute - Kubernetes/K8s best pattern for coordinated load across replicas, Docker to Azure ACAE KEDA is most scalable pattern)
3. GPU/TPU/Hardware (Get a GPU or use HF Zero, learn CUDA.  https://developer.nvidia.com/, https://huggingface.co/GPUModelSpotlight)
4. ML/LLM/Transformers (Huggingface python library Transformers is used by everyone and the cornerstone of LLMs/GAI - https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index)
5. For position 5 demand varies dramatically by org.  This one I subdivide to explain differences between organizations.
  1. Nvidia and OpenAI both have languages C++, and SQL.  These are frontrunners still due to HPC patterns for massive datasets and compute jobs.
  2. Anthropic next favors the React/Javascript/JS pattern and Artifacts and Computer Use in Claude set the SOTA.  This pattern can also be used direct from python libraries surprisingly (streamlit has good support for reactive componentns)
  3. Huggingface favors Open Source contribution and Community Engagement.  They are setting hardware independent patterns and have the worlds largest model and dataset hub with huggingface spaces.
6. Pytorch and Model Development.  Two main python libraries are at the heart of ML:  Torch and Tensorflow.  All four orgs favor Pytorch.
7. Datasets, Databases and SQL - ML starts with datasets.  ML models are direct descendants of datasets chosen and ML won't know what isn't in input datasets.
8. Cloud platforms.  Each have advantages, disadvantages and cost differences.  Top 3 in order for ML:  1. Azure, 2. AWS, 3. GCP
9. Linux/OS/MLOps.  State of art is to use Dockerfile to spin up replica instances.  Making it easy is SOTA.  Huggingface open source and platform are easiest and cheapest at scale for Global audience.  Replicate is #2.
10. 3D Computer Vision.  This one only Hugginface and NVIDIA have an edge with.  DeepRL patterns (Unity, OpenAI's gym, Nvidia's Magic3D and Omniverse blaze the trail.
