# 2. Perspective on Deepseek as ASI Class MoE Open Source Model
1. Open source and best techniques together made it possible and arXiv papers showed it was coming.  
2. It is very similar to Mistral/Mixtral backstory.  Distill experts.
3. Huggingface open source models showed how more narrow content MoE models perform better per domain.  
4. We shouldn't over invest or over organize in latest singular closed models.
5. We can use even new closed models to build new models that are faster and more performant for focused experts in MoE. 
6. The patterns of Self Reward, DeepRL, CoT, MoE, Distillation, and many other SOTA techniques on arXiv haven't been fully recombined yet where each have an edge. 
7. Input datasets matter, every input dataset is different. 
8. We should not assume our 50+ datasets big models in US are already their best since we know the content flaws. 
9. We have a long way to go making models better and open by intercombining techniques and models 
10. Any company with their content is key to their problem.  It wont always be general performance that leads for any given topic.

# 3. Thinking - Test Time Compute

1. In machine learning (ML) models, the "thinking" or "test time" compute refers to the computational resources required to make inferences or predictions using the trained model.
2. This is different from the training phase, where the model learns from data and optimizes its parameters. The thinking phase occurs when the trained model is deployed and used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
3. During the thinking phase, the following steps typically occur:
    1. **Input Processing**:
    2. The input data (e.g., an image, text, or numerical features) is preprocessed and transformed into a format that the model can understand.
    3. This may involve operations like resizing, normalization, or encoding.
4. **Forward Propagation**:
    1. The processed input is fed into the trained model, which performs a series of computations to produce an output.
    2. This involves passing the input through the layers of the model (e.g., convolutional layers, dense layers) and applying the learned weights and biases.
5. **Output Generation**:
    1. The final output of the model is generated, which could be a classification label, a numerical value, or a sequence of outputs, depending on the task and model architecture.
6. **Post-processing** (optional): In some cases, additional post-processing steps may be required to interpret or format the model's output for the desired application.
7. The computational requirements during the thinking phase depend on the complexity of the model architecture, the size of the input data, and the specific hardware used for inference (e.g., CPU, GPU, or specialized accelerators).
8. To create a "reasoner" model, which is a model that can perform reasoning or decision-making tasks, you typically need to incorporate components that can handle symbolic or logical representations, such as knowledge graphs, rules, or constraint satisfaction frameworks. These components allow the model to perform reasoning over structured knowledge, rather than just learning from data patterns.
9. An AI pipeline that incorporates a reasoner model might involve the following steps:
    1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect and preprocess the relevant data sources, which may include structured knowledge bases, rules, and domain-specific data.
    2. **Knowledge Representation**: Build a knowledge graph or other symbolic representation to encode the domain knowledge and rules.
    3. **Model Training**: Train a neural network or other machine learning model on the available data, potentially incorporating the knowledge representation as part of the model architecture or as a separate component.
    4. **Reasoning Engine**: Develop a reasoning engine that can perform logical inference, constraint satisfaction, or other reasoning tasks over the knowledge representation and the trained model's outputs.
    5. **Inference and Decision-Making**: Feed new inputs into the trained model, obtain the model's outputs, and use the reasoning engine to combine the outputs with the domain knowledge and rules to make decisions or inferences.
    6. **Output and Interpretation**: Present the final decisions or inferences in a human-interpretable format, potentially incorporating explanations or justifications based on the reasoning process.
    7. The thinking phase in a reasoner model involves the interplay between the trained machine learning model, the reasoning engine, and the knowledge representation, where the model's outputs are combined with symbolic reasoning to arrive at the final decision or inference.

# 4. Mixture of Experts and Test Time Compute
  1. **Mixture of Experts (MoE) Basics**:
    1. **Architecture**: An MoE model consists of multiple "expert" networks and a gating mechanism. Each expert is a specialized neural network trained to handle specific aspects or patterns in the data.
    2. **Gating Network**: This is typically a small neural network or mechanism that decides which experts should be activated for a given input. It learns to distribute the workload to the most relevant experts based on the input's characteristics.
    3. **Training**: During training, the model learns how to split the task among experts, with the gating network deciding which experts to consult for each input.
  2. **Test-Time Compute**:
    1. **Input Processing**:
    2. When an input arrives during testing, it first goes through the gating network.
    3. The gating network computes a probability distribution over the experts, deciding how much each expert should contribute to the final prediction.
  3. **Expert Activation**:
    1. Only a subset of experts are activated based on the gating network's output. This is crucial for efficiency because activating all experts for every input would be computationally expensive, especially for models with many experts.
  3. **Dynamic Routing:**
    1. The activated experts process the input independently or in parallel, typically producing some intermediate outputs or features.
  4. **Combination of Outputs**:
    1. The outputs from the activated experts are combined (often by weighted summation where weights are determined by the gating network). This combination forms the final prediction or decision for the input.
  5. **Efficiency and Adaptability**:
    1. Since not all experts are used for every input, MoE models can be more efficient than monolithic models with similar capabilities.
    2. This selective activation reduces computational load during inference, which is beneficial for real-time applications or when dealing with resource constraints.
  6. **Scalability**:
    1. Test-time compute with MoE models scales well because adding more experts can potentially increase model capacity without necessarily increasing the compute for every prediction, as only relevant experts are used.
  7. **Challenges and Considerations**:
    1. **Latency**: While MoE can reduce overall compute, there might be additional latency due to the gating decision process. However, this can be mitigated with efficient gating networks or pre-computation of common patterns.
    2. **Complexity**: The routing and management of experts require careful design to ensure that the model's complexity does not lead to increased inference time or resource usage in certain scenarios.
    3. **Hardware Utilization**: The effectiveness of MoE at test time also depends on how well the hardware can handle sparse computation (since some experts might be idle for some inputs).

In summary, test-time compute in MoE models is about smartly distributing the workload among expert networks based on the input's nature, which optimizes performance, reduces unnecessary computation, and can lead to better generalization by leveraging specialized knowledge from different experts.
