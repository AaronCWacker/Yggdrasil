Workload efficiency is key to our mission of democratizing state of the art and we are always looking to push the boundaries for faster, and more efficient ways to train and deploy models.

About the Role

As a Machine Learning Optimization Evangelist, your goal will be to increase the impact of the Hugging Face ML Optimization team by educating the community of ML practitioners on how they can benefit by accelerating their training and inference workloads.

The Hugging Face ML Optimization team is working through strategic collaborations with the most used AI Accelerators (incl. NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Gaudi, Inferentia, TPU), Clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure, Cloudflare) and Systems (Dell, Nutanix), to make it easy for the community to use Hugging Face models and libraries on these compute platforms.

These partnerships are core to Hugging Face product strategy as an open platform (no lock-in of customers), and monetization strategy to drive usage and revenue for our partners through commercial collaborations and product extensions.

This is not a marketing role, or a business development role. Your impact will be driving visibility and usage of integrations with strategic partners, through activities including:

Publishing technical blog posts
Contributing documentation and code examples
Speaking to business and technical audiences at partner conferences,
Participating in, or producing webinars
Building and evangelizing demos
Leading GTM conversations with strategic partners.
You will be at the forefront of Generative AI (and how to build practical stuff with open source). You will work hand in hand with the most important companies in AI. You will enjoy a lot of autonomy and full creative control, with the goal to have 10x more impact than a similar role at a big tech corporation.

About You

You are passionate about ML Engineering, building practical AI applications, putting them in production, and accelerating them to the best of the hardware ability. You love learning new challenging engineering concepts and technologies, and discussing them with engineers. You appreciate a good Developer Experience, and take pride in your code being easy to understand.

You are a great communicator and educator, comfortable (as much as one can be!) with public speaking to technical audiences.

You love engaging with the ML community in a positive and helpful way. Existing engagement in social platforms (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, etc) or other communication/education channels is expected. Having experience in Open Source development will be helpful..

About the Role

Hugging Face maintains a large collection of open source machine learning libraries, including transformers, diffusers, and datasets, just to name a few. However, these are all implemented in Python, meaning they aren’t as easily accessible to JavaScript/TypeScript developers. So, in order to grow the Hugging Face ecosystem, we decided to build projects like transformers.js and huggingface.js with the primary goal of bridging the gap between web development and machine learning.

WebML (Web Machine Learning) unlocks a range of new possibilities for building web applications by enabling models to run locally in the browser. Combining on-device machine learning with the plethora of APIs that browsers provide, empowers developers to create low-latency, interactive, and privacy-focused applications that can scale and reach users without them needing to install anything!

This internship operates at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and open-source community building. The focus will be to expand the Hugging Face ecosystem to web developers through the creation and maintenance of easy-to-use JS/TS machine learning libraries.

By the end of the internship, the candidate will have touched on many aspects of web machine learning, including: converting and optimizing models for in-browser inference (ONNX, quantization), enabling models to run in-browser at near-native speeds (WebGPU, WebNN, WASM), building demo applications to showcase new features, and fostering a collaborative open-source community.

ML Research Engineer Internship, GUI Agents - US Remote
RemoteInternshipsFull time

United States
Overview
Application
Description
At Hugging Face, we’re on a journey to democratize good AI. We are building the fastest growing platform for AI builders with over 5 million users & 100k organizations who collectively shared over 1M models, 300k datasets & 300k apps. Our open-source libraries have more than 400k+ stars on Github.

About the Role

2025 will be the year of Agents.

LLM agents, what are these? In short, agentic systems are a way to connect an LLM to the outside world, to let it perform actions and observations. The promises of such a setup are immense : it enables an LLM to get external knowledge to ground its reasoning, use reliable tools for specific tasks, and even self-correct errors through additional iterations.

An agentic system requires a powerful enough LLM to reason and plan actions. Now with the progress of LLMs in general and specifically open models overtaking closed ones, we have all weapons to build great agents. So Hugging Face is launching a moonshot in that direction.

Building agents is both exciting and challenging as it lies at the intersection of post-training, inference, orchestration as well as UX design.

During this internship you will work specifically on agents that take screen recordings from any GUI, and act through a mouse/keyboard setup. You may have seen such models from other companies: we’ll make them better and open.

This work will include the whole agent stack, from improving the framework, to preparing fine-tuning datasets, training recipes, and inference orchestration. You will leverage our compute CPU and H100 clusters for large scale processing and model training. Finally we’ll release any code we built, as well as the model serving as a foundation for the community to build on.
