last invention no reason to be scared

this is let's take a journey into the

future and explore how ai develops and
0:09
changes humanity paving the way for
0:11
robots that are too fast for humans to
0:13
see in 10 years time for the creation of

this evaporation is either a consequence

space-time energy expands across the
