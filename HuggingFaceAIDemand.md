Description
At Hugging Face, we’re on a journey to democratize good AI. We are building the fastest growing platform for AI builders with over 5 million users & 100k organizations who collectively shared over 1M models, 300k datasets & 300k apps. Our open-source libraries have more than 400k+ stars on Github.

About the Role

Hugging Face maintains a large collection of open source machine learning libraries, including transformers, diffusers, and datasets, just to name a few. However, these are all implemented in Python, meaning they aren’t as easily accessible to JavaScript/TypeScript developers. So, in order to grow the Hugging Face ecosystem, we decided to build projects like transformers.js and huggingface.js with the primary goal of bridging the gap between web development and machine learning.

WebML (Web Machine Learning) unlocks a range of new possibilities for building web applications by enabling models to run locally in the browser. Combining on-device machine learning with the plethora of APIs that browsers provide, empowers developers to create low-latency, interactive, and privacy-focused applications that can scale and reach users without them needing to install anything!

This internship operates at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and open-source community building. The focus will be to expand the Hugging Face ecosystem to web developers through the creation and maintenance of easy-to-use JS/TS machine learning libraries.

By the end of the internship, the candidate will have touched on many aspects of web machine learning, including: converting and optimizing models for in-browser inference (ONNX, quantization), enabling models to run in-browser at near-native speeds (WebGPU, WebNN, WASM), building demo applications to showcase new features, and fostering a collaborative open-source community.

About the Role

Quantization is a technique to reduce the computational and memory costs of running inference by representing the weights and activations with low-precision data types like 8-bit integer (int8) instead of the usual 32-bit floating point (float32). It is a very promising technique as it allows to run and fine-tune on consumer-grade hardware LLMs with minimal performance degradation.

This internship works at the intersections of software engineering, machine learning engineering, and education. The focus will be to integrate new quantization methods in Hugging Face ecosystem (transformers, accelerate, peft, diffusers), maintain existing integration (bitsandbytes, awq, autogptq) as well as making sure that the community is aware of these tools through benchmarks and blogposts. The ultimate goal of this internship is to drive forward quantization in the open source ecosystem.

Description
At Hugging Face, we’re on a journey to democratize good AI. We are building the fastest growing platform for AI builders with over 5 million users & 100k organizations who collectively shared over 1M models, 300k datasets & 300k apps. Our open-source libraries have more than 400k+ stars on Github.

About the Role

2025 will be the year of Agents.

LLM agents, what are these? In short, agentic systems are a way to connect an LLM to the outside world, to let it perform actions and observations. The promises of such a setup are immense : it enables an LLM to get external knowledge to ground its reasoning, use reliable tools for specific tasks, and even self-correct errors through additional iterations.

An agentic system requires a powerful enough LLM to reason and plan actions. Now with the progress of LLMs in general and specifically open models overtaking closed ones, we have all weapons to build great agents. So Hugging Face is launching a moonshot in that direction.

Building agents is both exciting and challenging as it lies at the intersection of post-training, inference, orchestration as well as UX design.

During this internship you will work specifically on agents that take screen recordings from any GUI, and act through a mouse/keyboard setup. You may have seen such models from other companies: we’ll make them better and open.

This work will include the whole agent stack, from improving the framework, to preparing fine-tuning datasets, training recipes, and inference orchestration. You will leverage our compute CPU and H100 clusters for large scale processing and model training. Finally we’ll release any code we built, as well as the model serving as a foundation for the community to build on.
