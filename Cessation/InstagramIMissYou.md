I deeply miss..

[insert thing we loved, how it has changed]

Lessons learned..


# Instagram RIP 88 weeks ago today - July 21st 2021.

I was a huge fan of instagram until marketing and visibility cross groups changed their alignment to what is popular and steered visibility to only paying high paying subscribers.

Instagram back in early 2021 was one of the best free sharing sites on the internet offering comparable exposure of all posts in equal form.

Since 88 weeks ago IG hasnt been 1/6th the platform mathematically in terms of regarding all individual seeking free sharing of their artistic ideals equally.
YOU CAN NOW pay big dollars every month to make it a non democratic platform that works for you however it is short lived since few remaining big ad dollar paying customers drown out other voices.

You might still hold favor since, but will accumatively need to spend money which is non favorable to artists who live on meek salary so equivalently it is unfair now until audiences gravitate to a different platform that re-establishes free speech equally to all not swayed by pay to win. 

The entire platform might be a loss now.  Another ad revenue source without caring about equality amongst non payer yet competing and possibly loosing world wide.

Open and free or so cheap to be almost free is hard to come by these days.  
Profit at ccost of compromising diversity isn't good for the individuals and ultimately leads to an adware site too loaded with junk, that nobody cares about but investors seeing losses and not understanding why.

Investors loose all value shortly after masses leave a platform, no longer caring and not liking to see their work minimized by the ads, and also having cheaper better and faster alternatives where they are not victims of compromise.

This is not a sustainable model anymore for users, and instead RLHF and other practices that humbly measure usefulness shine and this old way of pay to win declines and fades..  Long term it means it is vulnerrable to another platform which understands that people are equal, paying and non paying without penalizing non payers.

Last Vestige of free open source, equality on Instagram seems to have changed to one tenth as good on July 7, 2021

Sorry we miss you dearly and you were great back then as a platform that had the pulse.  Today you cant see it or feel it.  It is there howevver.

RIP platform for artists as of July 21, 2021.
Instagram original you are sorely missed.

Alternatives these days are a multitude, including MidJourney, Stable Diffusion, HuggingFace, Github, OpenAI (stay linked to free please), GCP, and any other vendorrs that see free equal representation a must.

Will miss you.  ðŸ˜˜
