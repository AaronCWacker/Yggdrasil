This is Story Recapped. Today,  I'm going to explain an action,  
0:05
crime, and sci-fi film called "Chappie."  Spoilers ahead! Watch out and take care.  
0:11
Due to the rising crime rates  in Johannesburg, South Africa,  
0:14
robotic police scouts are introduced. Tetravaal,  the robot's manufacturer, assures the public that  
0:19
they have a bulletproof Guard Key system that only  allows the company to make any software updates.  
0:24
Tetravaal also created a larger, remote-controlled  robot named the Moose, developed by weapons  
0:29
designer and former soldier Vincent Moore. Vincent  is against artificial intelligence, believing that  
0:36
human-controlled robots are still safer. Deon  Wilson, the developer of the robotic scouts,  
0:42
argues that their A.I. system is developed with  true intelligence that can think and feel.  
0:46
At Tetravaal robotics, a robot called Scout_22 is  transported in for repairs. The repairman comments  
0:52
how this robot is always damaged soon after  deployment. He repairs the robot's antennae  
0:56
and powers it back on. Immediately, Scout_22  arms itself and heads to its position.  
1:01
Meanwhile, a group of thieves - Ninja, Yolandi,  Pitbull, and Amerika - reach their gang's base  
1:11
where the leader, Hippo, berates them for  failing their last deal. He demands twenty  
1:16
million rands. Otherwise, he kills them. To prove  he's serious, Hippo shoots Pitbull then warns the  
1:21
rest that they have seven days to get his money.  When scouts arrive in the area, the gang fights  
1:26
the robots while Ninja and his team struggle to  escape. Ninja spots the man who took their keys,  
1:30
but he escapes in a car. Scout_22 sees the  car and fires at it, causing it to flip.  
1:35
Ninja fights his way to the burning vehicle  and retrieves his van's keys. Soon, Scout_22  
1:40
finds the Hippo, who shoots it with a rocket. At Tetravaal robotics, C.E.O Michelle Bradley  
1:47
announces that the police have ordered one-hundred  new scouts. The staff celebrates and congratulates  
1:52
Deon for his project's continued success. Michelle  then encourages Vincent that his project still has  
1:57
a chance. She advises him to keep the project's  costs down, but Vincent is tired of getting his  
2:01
project's funding cut. Deon is called to the  warehouse to check on Scout_22. Upon seeing  
2:07
the damage, Deon instructs the crew to salvage  the C.P.U. and crush the rest of its parts.  
2:12
In their hideout, Ninja's team recuperates.  However, Hippo calls Ninja, reminding him  
2:17
that they owe him. Yolandi suggests one final  job to pay off Hippo and escape with the rest  
2:21
of the money. Ninja thinks they can rob  a van that's transporting cash to a bank,  
2:25
but Amerika knows that the scouts will just come  after them. Yolandi formulates a plan to steal a  
2:30
scout's remote from one of the Tetravaal employees  to allow them to switch the robots off.  
2:34
That evening, Deon arrives home and records a  video journal, reporting his progress on his A.I.  
2:39
programming. After working on the A.I. code for  hours, Deon finally perfects the programming.  
2:45
Deon rushes to the warehouse and tells  the crew not to destroy Scout_22. He then  
2:49
announces to Michelle that he has finally created  an artificial intelligence smarter than a human.  
2:53
He promises that the A.I. will be able to judge  like a human, but Michelle laughs at his claims.  
2:59
He asks permission to install the program on  Scout_22, promising that it won't cost the  
3:03
company anything. Michelle refuses, given  all the paperwork that it will lead to.  
3:07
Deon goes to his desk, disappointed  about the outcome. After much thought,  
3:11
he decides to proceed anyway. Deon heads to the  warehouse and transports Scout_22 by himself. He  
3:17
then takes a Guard Key chip and loads a few spare  parts into his van. Deon drives back to his home,  
3:22
but Ninja's team blocks him and knocks him out. In the hideout, Ninja wakes up Deon and beats him.  
3:27
They demand that he give them the switch to turn  off the robots, but Deon reveals that the scouts  
3:31
don't have an off-switch. Amerika collects  the others, showing them what's in Deon's van.  
3:36
Yolandi gets an idea to have Deon build  the robot and program it to fight for them.  
3:40
When they bring this up to Deon, he explains  that the robot in his van is still in progress,  
3:44
but it can be trained to do whatever they want  if it works. He claims that the programming  
3:48
will be like a child evolving and learning. While Deon works on Scout_22, he reveals that  
3:53
the battery is unchangeable and will only run for  five days. After fixing the hardware, Deon uses  
3:58
the Guard Key to install the new A.I. then powers  it on. At first, it acts like a scared child,  
4:04
hiding from the humans, but Yolandi convinces  it to come out. Deon is happy to see that his  
4:08
program works. The robot becomes curious and  slowly learns their language, much to everyone's  
4:13
amusement. Yolandi names the robot Chappie. Ninja  then intervenes and pulls Deon out of the scene,  
4:20
threatening him not to return. Deon, however,  stresses that Chappie is his creation, and he  
4:25
must continue to train him. Yolandi tries to  convince Ninja to allow Deon to return, but Ninja  
4:30
fires a warning shot, forcing Deon to leave. At Tetravaal Robotics, Vincent sneaks into the  
4:35
warehouse to retrieve the Guard Key but finds  it missing. Upon accessing the computer,  
4:40
he discovers that the Guard Key  is still installed on Scout_22.  
4:43
In the morning, Chappie explores the hideout  and becomes intrigued by random items.  
4:47
Ninja finds it and proceeds to train it to shoot  a gun. However, the robot is scared of him. Still,  
4:52
Ninja forces a gun onto Chappie, and it ends  up shooting a punching bag instead. Yolandi  
4:57
scolds Ninja, arguing that the robot isn't ready.  Ninja is frustrated and reminds them that they're  
5:02
dead if they don't get the money for Hippo. At Tetravaal Robotics, Deon researches early  
5:06
child development until Vincent interrupts  him. Vincent asks him for the Guard Key,  
5:11
explaining that he wants to use it to check  the security levels for Moose. Deon denies,  
5:15
given that they have protocols against this.  Vincent then holds him down and aims a gun at him,  
5:19
blaming him for his project's lack of funds.  He demands the Guard Key again, but Deon still  
5:24
refuses. Vincent pulls the trigger, then laughs,  revealing that his gun isn't loaded. Still, Deon  
5:30
is driven to the edge, so he leaves the office,  not knowing that Vincent is following him.  
5:34
At the hideout, Yolandi and Amerika teach Chappie.  Yolandi convinces Chappie to call her mommy,  
5:39
and Amerika is amused when it starts copying  him. Soon, Deon arrives, but Yolandi warns  
5:44
him that Ninja will be back soon. Deon is just  happy to see his creation, though he's stunned  
5:49
when it starts talking like a gangster. He asks  Chappie to promise him not to do anything illegal,  
5:53
much to Yolandi's disappointment. Deon then shows  Chappie a book and teaches him how to paint.  
5:58
Vincent sneaks around the hideout and sees Deon  with Chappie. He's surprised to see the robot  
6:03
paint and see the Guard Key installed on Chappie.  Afterward, he drives back to the office.  
6:08
Deon and Yolandi are amazed to see Chappie paint,  but their joy is cut short when Ninja arrives.  
6:13
Ninja shoots Deon, but Yolandi  pushes him, making him miss.  
6:16
Yolandi argues that they're just teaching  Chappie, but Ninja refuses to hear it. Deon  
6:21
threatens to call the police on Ninja for  mistreating his robot before leaving.  
6:25
When he's gone, Yolandi and Ninja argue over  Chappie, but Amerika receives a call about a  
6:29
job that's worth six hundred million rands. To  prepare Chappie, Ninja and Amerika take Chappie  
6:35
out and leave him on a lot where a small gang  is hanging out, thinking it will teach the robot  
6:39
how to defend itself. They then leave the robot  behind, allowing the gang to attack Chappie.  
6:44
Deon arrives home, frustrated over losing  his A.I. to the thugs. He gets a call from  
6:49
Tetravaal Security, demanding that he return  the Guard Key by the end of the day.  
6:53
Meanwhile, Chappie struggles to return to the  hideout. Soon, it rests on an empty lot and meets  
6:58
a dog. Vincent and his team locate Chappie and  blast it with an E.M.P. wave to disable it. With  
7:03
Chappie in their van, the men attempt to retrieve  the Guard Key but the robot struggles. Frustrated,  
7:09
Vincent saws off its arm. Once Vincent retrieves  the Guard Key, he moves to dismantle the robot  
7:14
further, but Chappie fights back and escapes. Finally, Chappie arrives at the hideout. Yolandi  
7:19
berates Ninja for allowing it to get hurt.  Amerika installs a spare arm on Chappie,  
7:23
allowing it to move again. Later, Yolandi reads  the book that Deon left behind for Chappie.  
7:28
Using the book, Yolandi teaches Chappie that  it's what's inside that makes it special.  
7:32
The next day, Deon purchases a gun to get Chappie  back. In the hideout, Chappie makes a doll to look  
7:37
like Yolandi, but Ninja interrupts him. Ninja  apologizes to the robot, promising that he will  
7:42
help it be stronger. Ninja teaches Chappie to act  like a gangster, but it refuses to shoot people.  
7:47
This angers Ninja, but Amerika calms him down.  Amerika then teaches Chappie to stab people,  
7:52
lying that it will make them sleep. The two then  teach Chappie to use other weapons like nunchucks  
7:57
and throwing stars. Afterward, they paint on  Chappie and accessorize him before leaving.  
8:02
Ninja instructs Chappie to retrieve a car from  a man by threatening him with a gun. However,  
8:06
Chappie drops the gun and uses a wrench instead,  destroying the car in the process. As they drive  
8:11
away, Ninja scolds the robots and tells him that  they need the car to be nice to sell it. Chappie  
8:16
tries again and successfully steals a few cars. Later, Ninja and Amerika take Chappie to the  
8:21
King's hideout. The gang inside panic upon  seeing Chappie, thinking that he's the police.  
8:26
They leave Chappie at the entrance  before heading up to see the King.  
8:30
The King offers them weapons and explosives for  their heist in exchange for the cars. Meanwhile,  
8:35
Chappie inspects the surroundings and finds a dead  dog. Ninja returns and tells it that life is hard  
8:40
and it has to fight to survive. Chappie denies  this, saying that it's indestructible. However,  
8:45
Ninja points out that it's low in battery.  Its battery is melted into its body,  
8:49
so once it runs out, Chappie dies. Ninja  argues that Deon put him in a broken body,  
8:55
but Chappie stresses that Deon cares for  him. Ninja then promises to get Chappie a  
8:59
new body if they do the heist, finally  convincing the robot to help them.  
9:02
At their hideout, Deon arrives, but Yolandi tells  him that Ninja took Chappie. Moments later, Ninja  
9:08
and the rest return. Deon tries to get Chappie's  attention, but it ignores him. Deon scolds Chappie  
9:13
for helping Ninja with their crimes, but Chappie  argues that Deon made it with a dying battery.  
9:18
Meanwhile, Vincent sneaks back to  the warehouse and installs a program  
9:21
for all the remaining scouts. The program  causes the scout's firmware to malfunction,  
9:25
resulting in multiple accidents. Chappie's  C.P.U. also fries, and Deon panics, aiming a  
9:31
gun at Ninja before taking Chappie away. The city plunges into chaos with the robot  
9:35
scouts offline. Due to this, the  human police force is deployed.  
9:39
With his plan successful, Vincent deletes  the program that shut down the scouts to  
9:43
leave no trace. However, Deon arrives at the  warehouse before the deletion is complete.  
9:48
Deon drags Chappie into a workstation to reboot  the robot. When he plugs Chappie into a computer,  
9:53
the computer detects Vincent's program as  a virus, so he quarantines it, preventing  
9:58
Vincent from deleting the program on Chappie.  Soon, Chappie reboots, and Deon hurries him to  
10:03
leave, but Chappie gets interested in Moose.  Chappie gets distracted by another scout body,  
10:07
hoping that transferring itself into the robot  will save it. Deon reveals that it's not possible  
10:12
because Chappie is conscious, and therefore  not data that can be copied. Hearing this,  
10:16
Chappie steals the neural helmet that  controls Moose before running away.  
10:20
Before Deon can chase it, he  receives a call from Michelle.  
10:23
A group of police officers enters the warehouse,  so Vincent shuts his computer down and leaves.  
10:28
Chappie returns to the hideout and hooks  up the neural helmet to a computer.  
10:32
When Yolandi asks what it's doing, it puts  the helmet on her to check if it works.  
10:36
Chappie wants to use the helmet's programming to  copy its own consciousness into a new body.  
10:40
Meanwhile, Michelle orders Deon to figure  out what happened to the scout robots.  
10:44
Vincent tries to use this opportunity to deploy  Moose, but Michelle still refuses him.  
10:49
By morning, Chappie tries to run a program to  copy its consciousness into the neural helmet  
10:54
but fails. After many tries, Chappie finally  loads its consciousness on the computer.  
10:59
Ninja then collects him for the heist. The team gears up for the heist and corners a  
11:03
transport truck. Chappie pulls the officers out of  the van and collects the money. During this, Deon  
11:08
finally discovers why the scouts went offline. He  confronts Vincent, but a news report of Chappie  
11:13
helping the heist catches his attention. Deon  threatens Vincent before leaving to help Chappie.  
11:18
On the road, Chappie confronts the officer he  attacked, wondering why he's not sleeping. Chappie  
11:23
apologizes to the officer before leaving. Vincent approaches Michelle and lies that  
11:27
Deon's new A.I. programming caused the scouts to  go offline. He recounts seeing Deon bring in a  
11:32
sentient scout last night. Remembering Deon asking  for permission to use the new A.I. days ago,  
11:37
Michelle is convinced and  approves Moose's deployment.  
11:40
Moose is soon activated while Deon rushes to  a restricted area to arm himself. He loads  
11:45
the equipment in his van and drives off. Vincent  puts on his neural helmet and operates Moose.  
11:50
In the van, Chappie insists that they buy its  new body, but Ninja admits that they can't.  
11:55
Realizing that it's been lied to, Chappie becomes  aggressive. Deon soon catches up to their van just  
11:59
as Chappie throws Ninja out. Chappie berates  everyone for lying to it. Deon, however,  
12:04
informs them that Moose is arriving to destroy  Chappie. Deon has gathered weapons to disable  
12:09
Moose, but Chappie no longer wants to fight. Suddenly, Hippo arrives and demands both the money  
12:14
and the robot. Ninja fires at Hippo's gang while  Chappie fiddles with the materials in Deon's van.  
12:19
However, Moose arrives, stopping the gunfight.  Amerika fires at the robot, but it rips his body  
12:25
apart. Angered, Ninja fires at the machine,  and it burns their van in retaliation,  
12:30
burning the money as well. Moose then flies up  and launches explosives at them. Vincent laughs  
12:35
at seeing the men scramble away from the bombs. Finally, Vincent spots Deon. Chappie finally  
12:40
emerges, fires at the larger robot, and throws a  bomb at it. But before Chappie could detonate the  
12:45
bomb, Vincent fires at its arm. Moose shoots  at the people, so Chappie takes Yolandi out  
12:50
of the way. Deon gets in his van to escape,  but Hippo attacks him to steal the vehicle.  
12:55
Ninja pulls Hippo off the man but gets shot in  the leg. Hippo then shoots Deon in the stomach.  
13:00
Ninja slams a shovel at Hippo then calls  Chappie to help Deon back into the van.  
13:05
Ninja and Yolandi get into the van and drive off,  but Chappie stops to retrieve the neural helmet.  
13:10
Vincent fires at them and damages the helmet  before Chappie can get it. Chappie tells Ninja  
13:14
that they have to go back to the Tetravaal  warehouse to get another helmet to save Deon.  
13:18
Ninja then volunteers to distract Moose while  they escape, despite Yolandi's protests. As the  
13:24
van drives away, Ninja fires at Moose. Unwilling  to let him die, Yolandi hops out of the van,  
13:29
picks up a gun, and fires it at the machine.  Moose then shoots at Yolandi, killing her.  
13:34
Chappie catches Yolandi's body, then spots the  detonator nearby. It jumps forward and detonates  
13:40
the bomb, blowing up Moose into pieces. Ninja and Chappie mourn over Yolandi's  
13:45
body. Enraged, Chappie asks Deon who killed  his mother and promises to crush the man.  
13:50
Chappie drives into Tetravaal robotics and carries  Deon inside. Vincent shoots at Chappie then runs,  
13:56
but the robot throws a wrench on his leg. Vincent  limps into the office area, and Chappie continues  
14:01
to pursue, yelling at him for killing Yolandi.  The robot beats up Vincent close to death  
14:06
before claiming to have forgiven him. Then, Chappie carries Deon into the warehouse  
14:11
to transfer his consciousness into a robot.  Chappie puts the neural helmet on Deon just as the  
14:16
police arrive. The robot activates the program,  transferring Deon's consciousness to the spare  
14:21
robot. The spare robot suddenly wakes up as Deon.  Deon wants to do the same for Chappie, but with no  
14:27
other spare robot, Chappie has accepted its fate.  Deon remembers that Vincent used his computer to  
14:33
transfer the virus to the scouts. He can use it  to transfer Chappie's consciousness into another  
14:38
body. Chappie loads up the program while the  police are breaking the doors open. Deon activates  
14:43
the program, and Chappie's body goes limp. When the police finally open the doors,  
14:48
Deon escapes into a vent and reunites  with Chappie in his new body.  
14:51
At the hideout, Ninja burns all their items in  mourning. Amongst Yolandi's items, he finds a  
14:56
flash drive labeled "Mommy's consciousness."  Ninja remembers how Chappie used the neural  
15:01
helmet on Yolandi first, successfully copying her  consciousness. The next day, they bury Yolandi,  
15:06
and Chappie promises to give her a new body. Due to the events, the authorities have suspended  
15:11
the use of robotic officers. The police have also  called a warrant to arrest Chappie. Days later,  
15:17
Chappie remotely accesses Tetravaal's robotic  warehouse to create a new body for Yolandi.
