hypergraph to mermaid graph code listings

# 01 Input:
Create a streamlit app.py which takes a few transccript summary numbered outlines and creates a matching mermaid model which shows an AII architecture graph with emojis where nodes and relationships amongst the transcript points are connected properly into a hierarchical graph where each node and arrow is labeled with minimal words but distilled condensed summary from the line along with the leading appropriate emoji.  Show full code listing of the mermaid model, and assume I will show these inside a streamlit app.py with markdown code inside as a variable and then use either mermaid in streamlit or mermaid as a script with html component to make it into an app.   

1. üöÄ Open AI, Oracle, and SoftBank just announced a massive deal with President Trump called Project Stargate.
2. üåå Despite the name, unfortunately, this has nothing to do with intergalactic wormhole infrastructure.
3. üí∞ Their plan is to invest a staggering $500 billion in the United States to build the largest data centers the world has ever seen.
4. ü§ñ The sole purpose of these data centers is to churn out AI slop.
5. üõ°Ô∏è To put this number in perspective, the US annual defense budget is $850 billion, but that pays for aircraft carriers, fighter jets, and space lasers.
6. üòî But there was someone who didn't get picked for the Stargate team, and he's feeling really bummed out right now.
7. üöó His name is Elon, and everyone seems to forget that he has an AI company too.
8. üè¶ He claims that SoftBank doesn't actually have the money secured and says the whole Stargate thing is fake.
9. üê¶ Sam Altman then came in with a famous high-road clapback, where he compliments Elon but says he's wrong and then invites him to come visit the project that's already underway.
10. üíº Then Saia jumps in to back up Altman, saying, "He's good for his $80 billion. I'm good for my $80 billion."
11. üé• In today's video, we'll find out what the Stargate project really is and why you should be excited but also terrified.
12. üìÖ It is January 23rd, 2025, and you're watching The Code Report.
13. üèóÔ∏è Project Stargate is an AI infrastructure project where the goal is to invest $500 billion in the United States to build data centers.
14. üí∏ Now, this project is not actually funded by taxpayers but instead will come from investors secured by the Japanese bank SoftBank.
15. üíº Masayoshi Son is the money guy, Sam Altman is the gadgets guy, and Larry Ellison is the muscle.
16. ‚ö° These data center facilities will require tons of energy, and Trump is the gas man who will get that done by using executive orders to divert power to get these things built.
17. üë∑ They claim this will create 100,000 new jobs, which will then be eliminated by AI when they finish building this thing.
18. üåü On the bright side, this project could make AI cheaper and more accessible.
19. üè• They're really hyping up its medical benefits, where Larry Ellison said it will enable personalized medicine for everyone and that it should be able to develop customized mRNA vaccines to cure cancer.
20. ‚õµ Ellison is most well-known as a champion sailor, but he also became one of the richest men in the world by creating the first commercial SQL database.
21. ‚òï He also owns my favorite programming language, Java, and is fighting a legal battle with Dino to maintain control of the JavaScript trademark.
22. üïµÔ∏è But he also has a dystopian vision for society where everything is monitored by AI to keep citizens on their best behavior.
23. üìπ Citizens will be on their best behavior because we're constantly recording and reporting everything that's going on, and we're using AI to monitor the video.
24. üö® This vision will become a reality in the very near future.
25. üèóÔ∏è Stargate currently has 10 data centers under construction in Abilene, Texas, and is expanding to more states soon.
26. üïµÔ∏è What's interesting is that the government used to have a different Stargate project back in the '70s, which was a top-secret CIA project to explore the possibility of psychic warfare.
27. üîÆ These names are no accident. Oracle sees the future; Stargate is a portal to other dimensions, and OpenAI is the one who gets to open the portal.
28. ‚è≥ The timing is perfect because, after years of saying OpenAI would definitely never go for profit, OpenAI just laid out plans to go for-profit and give Sam Altman equity to make him billions of dollars richer.
29. üéôÔ∏è That's surprising because he told Congress in 2023, "I'm doing this because I love it. Make a lot of money? Do I? I'm doing this because I love it."
30. üò° Elon is seething right now because he's about to release Grok 3, which is a reasoning model like Deep Seek or 01, and based on this one biased example, could be superior to those models.
31. üëÄ Now, I might get in trouble with my Illuminati handler for telling you this, but all this drama and beefing is scripted and fake.
32. ü§ù Elon and Altman are bros who started OpenAI together.
33. üê¶ Ellison helped Elon buy Twitter; they're all connected to the PayPal Mafia and Peter Thiel, whose prot√©g√© JD Vance just became the vice president.
34. ü¶é He'll take over as president in 2027 but is actually controlled by reptilians who have been alive since Roman times.
35. üèõÔ∏è All roads lead to Rome, and that's why Elon did this autistic Roman salute recently to mark the beginning of the tech bro dynasty that will reign supreme for the next 500 years.

### Explanation:
- **Mermaid Diagram**: This script defines a Mermaid diagram in a text block which describes the relationships between various points from the transcript summary with emojis as labels for nodes. Each node and arrow is connected based on the logical flow from the summary points.
- **Streamlit Integration**: The diagram is embedded within a Streamlit app using the `st.markdown` function with the `mermaid` code block syntax. Streamlit can render Mermaid diagrams directly if you have the appropriate configuration or plugin for Mermaid rendering.

### Usage:
- You need to have Streamlit installed (`pip install streamlit`). 
- Run the script with `streamlit run app.py` in your command line. 
- Streamlit will open your default browser and display the app with the Mermaid diagram.

### Note:
- Streamlit's native support for Mermaid might require additional configuration or a plugin. If not natively supported, you might need to use an external Mermaid JS script and render the diagram through an HTML component. Here, I assume Streamlit can handle Mermaid directly for simplicity. If you encounter issues, you would need to include Mermaid JS in your app's HTML output:

```python
1. üöÄ Last week, Chinese company Deep Seek shocked the world when they walked right over OpenAI by releasing the open-source R1 model.
2. üèÜ Not only does it beat their $200 01 reasoning model, but it also beats Claude Sonet and Gemini.
3. üìä It wins on key benchmarks, but more importantly, it passes My Vibe test along with many others on the internet.
4. ü§ñ As long as you don't ask it what happened on April 15th, 1989, R1 even wins at math, which is crazy considering OpenAI had the answers in advance.
5. üåê Over the last few days, normies have been learning about R1, and it went viral to become the number one app in America.
6. üí• This is a big problem for Big Tech because, in order for the grift to keep on grifting, artificial intelligence needs to be hard and take thousands of GPUs to pull off.
7. üí∞ But Deep Seek's R1 cost less than $10 million and was actually the side project of a hedge fund where their only goal is to create long-term social value.
8. üìâ Wall Street is terrified, and Nvidia stock is in for a bloodbath today.
9. üè¶ Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the AI boom, but the whole bubble just got one-shotted by a brutal reality check.
10. üé• In today's video, we'll find out how Deep Seek just changed the course of history.
11. üìÖ It is January 26, 2025, and you're watching The Code Report.
12. ü§Ø Big Tech is literally shaking right now.
13. üê¶ Is Sam Altman coping with a dramatic tweet? "A revolution can neither be made nor stopped. The only thing that can be done is for one of several of its children to give it direction by dent to victories."
14. ü§î I'm not sure if that's Napoleon Dynamite or Napoleon Bonaparte, but the funny thing is he damn near got ratioed by someone with an anime profile picture that said, "It's not that deep, bro. Just release a better model."
15. üÜì In addition to trying to remain competitive with Deep Seek, OpenAI is also offering its 01 Mini model to free users.
16. üõ†Ô∏è But that's not all; they also released a new thing called Operator, which gives AI access to a browser and allows it to click on buttons and fill out forms on your behalf.
17. üéÆ This is a game changer because that means you can have ChatGPT go attend your court-appointed DUI courses or anything else you might have to do online.
18. üåê In the future, humans will no longer need websites or UIs, only APIs that can interact with the AI's Operator.
19. üí∏ Operator is currently only available to people on the $200 plan and overall gets pretty mixed reviews.
20. üá®üá≥ That's cool and all, but the Chinese are really crushing it right now.
21. üé® Deep Seek is one thing, but they also released this thing called Hun You on 3D, which can generate 3D meshes and textures.
22. üñåÔ∏è That's huge for people like me who have spent years failing to get good at Blender.
23. ü§Ø But the crazy thing about Deep Seek is that it was just a side project that cost very little money to produce.
24. üåç Even Mark Andreessen called it one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs he's ever seen, a profound gift to the world.
25. üìâ And because of that, the stock market is panicking and just wiped out nearly a trillion dollars in value, with Nvidia being the biggest loser, followed by other chip companies like Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom.
26. üíª You see, Nvidia has had basically a monopoly on AI training for the last decade because they have better Linux drivers than AMD, and all the machine learning algorithms are optimized for libraries like CUDA, which is proprietary and can only run on Nvidia GPUs.
27. üîó And they have the infrastructure to connect all these GPUs together at scale.
28. üìà As AI models get bigger and more popular, so do the profits of Nvidia.
29. üçè But someone got Deep Seek running on a few Apple M2 Ultras, and that's the 680 billion parameter top-of-the-line model.
30. üò± And that's terrifying if you're a tech investor pouring billions of dollars into AI because if the best state-of-the-art model can operate on relatively cheap consumer hardware and it's free and open source and developed in China, how are we going to make any money?
31. üõ∞Ô∏è People are calling this the Sputnik moment when Russia launched the first artificial satellite into space in 1957.
32. üá∫üá∏ The United States was shocked at the time, and it took over a decade to make a comeback when America made its pinnacle achievement of filming a man on the moon in Nevada.
33. üòÇ That's a joke, of course, and even the smartest technology in the world, Deep Seek, believes in the moon landings.
34. üöÇ We had a good run on this AI hype train, but now it's time to move on.
35. üß† I'm looking forward to brain chips, quantum computers, artificial meat printers, nanorobots, digital resurrection, and tens of other tech that will make the world a better place.

1. üöÄ Open AI, Oracle, and SoftBank just announced a massive deal with President Trump called Project Stargate.
2. üåå Despite the name, unfortunately, this has nothing to do with intergalactic wormhole infrastructure.
3. üí∞ Their plan is to invest a staggering $500 billion in the United States to build the largest data centers the world has ever seen.
4. ü§ñ The sole purpose of these data centers is to churn out AI slop.
5. üõ°Ô∏è To put this number in perspective, the US annual defense budget is $850 billion, but that pays for aircraft carriers, fighter jets, and space lasers.
6. üòî But there was someone who didn't get picked for the Stargate team, and he's feeling really bummed out right now.
7. üöó His name is Elon, and everyone seems to forget that he has an AI company too.
8. üè¶ He claims that SoftBank doesn't actually have the money secured and says the whole Stargate thing is fake.
9. üê¶ Sam Altman then came in with a famous high-road clapback, where he compliments Elon but says he's wrong and then invites him to come visit the project that's already underway.
10. üíº Then Saia jumps in to back up Altman, saying, "He's good for his $80 billion. I'm good for my $80 billion."
11. üé• In today's video, we'll find out what the Stargate project really is and why you should be excited but also terrified.
12. üìÖ It is January 23rd, 2025, and you're watching The Code Report.
13. üèóÔ∏è Project Stargate is an AI infrastructure project where the goal is to invest $500 billion in the United States to build data centers.
14. üí∏ Now, this project is not actually funded by taxpayers but instead will come from investors secured by the Japanese bank SoftBank.
15. üíº Masayoshi Son is the money guy, Sam Altman is the gadgets guy, and Larry Ellison is the muscle.
16. ‚ö° These data center facilities will require tons of energy, and Trump is the gas man who will get that done by using executive orders to divert power to get these things built.
17. üë∑ They claim this will create 100,000 new jobs, which will then be eliminated by AI when they finish building this thing.
18. üåü On the bright side, this project could make AI cheaper and more accessible.
19. üè• They're really hyping up its medical benefits, where Larry Ellison said it will enable personalized medicine for everyone and that it should be able to develop customized mRNA vaccines to cure cancer.
20. ‚õµ Ellison is most well-known as a champion sailor, but he also became one of the richest men in the world by creating the first commercial SQL database.
21. ‚òï He also owns my favorite programming language, Java, and is fighting a legal battle with Dino to maintain control of the JavaScript trademark.
22. üïµÔ∏è But he also has a dystopian vision for society where everything is monitored by AI to keep citizens on their best behavior.
23. üìπ Citizens will be on their best behavior because we're constantly recording and reporting everything that's going on, and we're using AI to monitor the video.
24. üö® This vision will become a reality in the very near future.
25. üèóÔ∏è Stargate currently has 10 data centers under construction in Abilene, Texas, and is expanding to more states soon.
26. üïµÔ∏è What's interesting is that the government used to have a different Stargate project back in the '70s, which was a top-secret CIA project to explore the possibility of psychic warfare.
27. üîÆ These names are no accident. Oracle sees the future; Stargate is a portal to other dimensions, and OpenAI is the one who gets to open the portal.
28. ‚è≥ The timing is perfect because, after years of saying OpenAI would definitely never go for profit, OpenAI just laid out plans to go for-profit and give Sam Altman equity to make him billions of dollars richer.
29. üéôÔ∏è That's surprising because he told Congress in 2023, "I'm doing this because I love it. Make a lot of money? Do I? I'm doing this because I love it."

The Deep seek Rabbit Hole just keeps getting deeper and deeper. After being deeply wounded by Deep seek last week, open AI is now reportedly accusing them of IP theft. To make matters even worse, a second Chinese model just hit the timeline. If you're just waking up from a coma, the legend goes like this: a Chinese hedge fund built a state-of-the-art reasoning model that surpassed open AI and only spent $5.5 million to train it. Then, they gave the world a 100% discount code to use it. That was devastating to Big Tech and especially open AI, who have been gradually trying to convince people that AI is hard and we need things like $500 billion Stargate data centers. Now, in order to get the AI hype train back on track, the new White House AIAR and PayPal Mafia member David Sachs just went on the news and said they have substantial evidence that deep seek stole open AI's outputs to fine-tune their models, a technique known as distillation that is strictly forbidden in their terms of service. The irony here is not only palpable; one might describe it as artificial super irony. You might remember how open AI vacuumed up the entire internet and all its copyrighted materials without asking anybody for permission. Elon accused them of scraping Twitter. George RR Martin and a bunch of other authors are suing, among many other lawsuits around the world. But I need to let you in on a tech bro founder secret: we do shady stuff and then ask for forgiveness later because, once a company reaches critical mass, there's no stopping it. Uber and Airbnb are prime examples, and thus far, open AI has mostly prevailed in their copyright infringement legal battles. In today's video, we'll take a closer look at the technical details of deep seek, how it bypassed CUDA, and try to find out if it actually ripped off open AI. It is January 29th, 2025, and you're watching the code report. My conspiracy theory is that open AI has been deep seek all along, and this was just the most genius marketing trick of all time to assert their dominance. I wouldn't put it past Chief Persuasion Officer Sam Altman; he's just a con man, and he lies to everyone. But now, open AI and Microsoft are accusing deep seek of distillation, where you take one big expensive model like GPT-4 and use its outputs to transfer knowledge to a smaller model. Thus far, they haven't provided any hard evidence, but there are screenshots like this going around the internet where deep seek provides a response that should only come from chat GPT. That's not a smoking gun, though, because this type of content is all over the internet now, so deep seek could have learned it organically. However, Microsoft, which provides the servers for much of open AI's compute, said they observed someone in China extracting large volumes of data from the open AI API, and they believe these accounts may be linked to deep seek. In other words, deep seek is basically Robin Hood, stealing from the rich to give to the poor. Distillation generally provides better results compared to reinforcement learning, where you actually feed the model new data with a reward function. Distillation is not controversial, and deep seek's models are distilled from LLaMA and Quen. In fact, you can even distill open AI models as long as you don't use the API to build a rival model, and that appears to be the root of open AI's beef. And get this: Alibaba just released Quen 2.5 Max just minutes ago, and although it's not a reasoning model, it's an open model that beats deep seek, Claude, and GPT-4 on these benchmarks. And not only that, but yet another Chinese model called Kim 1.5 just came out and apparently beats open AI GPT-4. We're now in a China versus China AI race with the United States falling behind. Meanwhile, Europe is focused on other technological innovations like bottle caps you can't take off. Many people have complained that deep seek is highly censored, but it's relatively easy to jailbreak if you're a senior prompt engineer. But speaking of irony, last year, MidJourney accused Stability AI of image theft, but none of that matters now because deep seek also just released the Jan series models, which do diffusion-based image generation. While the quality is not as good as Stable Diffusion or MidJourney, it's yet another open-source model you can use commercially, and that's good news for humanity. But another interesting detail about deep seek is that it achieved 10x better efficiency than other models in part by not using CUDA, Nvidia's proprietary platform for running code on a GPU. Instead, they used Nvidia Parallel Thread Execution directly, which conceptually would be similar to building a website with assembly code and is just another example of how cracked these deep seek engineers really are. Now, another major criticism of deep seek is that when you use it on the web, all your prompts, data, and keystrokes go to China. If you care about privacy, though, you shouldn't be using the internet anyway. Instead, you should use it locally like I did in this video on my second channel. But the most important trend here is that open source is winning. That means if you're a developer, now is the time to start building products people love, and you can do that with a truly awesome open-source tool called PostHog, the sponsor of today's video. It's like a Swiss army knife to analyze, test, observe, and deploy better features. Its product analytics tool can help you understand your customers and build funnels. Its web analytics can replace Google Analytics, and session replay will help you understand how users actually interact with your app, not to mention feature flags and UI experiments like A/B tests, just to name a few of the features. But most importantly, it's easy to implement thanks to SDKs for web, mobile, and server-side apps with excellent docs designed for developers. Not only is it open-source and self-hostable, but it also has a fully managed, no-card-required free plan. Give PostHog a try with the link below. This has been the code report. Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next one.

28. üá®üá≥ We're now in a China versus China AI race with the United States falling behind.
29. üá™üá∫ Meanwhile, Europe is focused on other technological innovations like bottle caps you can't take off.
30. üîí Many people have complained that deep seek is highly censored, but it's relatively easy to jailbreak if you're a senior prompt engineer.
31. üé® But speaking of irony, last year, MidJourney accused Stability AI of image theft, but none of that matters now because deep seek also just released the Jan series models, which do diffusion-based image generation.
32. üñºÔ∏è While the quality is not as good as Stable Diffusion or MidJourney, it's yet another open-source model you can use commercially, and that's good news for humanity.
33. ‚öôÔ∏è But another interesting detail about deep seek is that it achieved 10x better efficiency than other models in part by not using CUDA, Nvidia's proprietary platform for running code on a GPU.
34. üß© Instead, they used Nvidia Parallel Thread Execution directly, which conceptually would be similar to building a website with assembly code and is just another example of how cracked these deep seek engineers really are.
35. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Now, another major criticism of deep seek is that when you use it on the web, all your prompts, data, and keystrokes go to China.
36. üîí If you care about privacy, though, you shouldn't be using the internet anyway.
37. üíª Instead, you should use it locally like I did in this video on my second channel.
38. üèÜ But the most important trend here is that open source is winning.
39. üõ†Ô∏è That means if you're a developer, now is the time to start building products people love, and you can do that with a truly awesome open-source tool called PostHog, the sponsor of today's video.
40. üó°Ô∏è It's like a Swiss army knife to analyze, test, observe, and deploy better features.
41. üìä Its product analytics tool can help you understand your customers and build funnels.
42. üåê Its web analytics can replace Google Analytics, and session replay will help you understand how users actually interact with your app, not to mention feature flags and UI experiments like A/B tests, just to name a few of the features.
43. üõ†Ô∏è But most importantly, it's easy to implement thanks to SDKs for web, mobile, and server-side apps with excellent docs designed for developers.
44. üè† Not only is it open-source and self-hostable, but it also has a fully managed, no-card-required free plan.
45. üîó Give PostHog a try with the link below.
46. üé• This has been the code report.
47. üôè Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next one.

```python
Restructure this to first remove all timestamps, second: split it into a listing of complete sentences and number them within a markdown outline with an appropriate emojis at start of each outline line after the number.  Third, create a markdown tree of the sentences showing full markdown code as streamlit app.py in a python variable.  Fourth, create a second markdown outline tree with same parameterss (emoji outline structure etc) for all glossary words like distillation and define them in glossary with short sentence and emojis in same outline format.

0:00
the Deep seek Rabbit Hole just keeps
0:01
getting deeper and deeper after being
0:03
deeply wounded by Deep seek last week
0:05
open AI is now reportedly accusing them
0:07
of Ip theft and to make matters even
0:09
worse a second Chinese model just hit
0:11
the timeline if you're just waking up
0:12
from a coma the legend goes like this a
0:14
Chinese hedge fund built a
0:16
state-of-the-art reasoning model that
0:17
surpassed open A1 and only spent $5.5
0:20
million to train it then gave the world
0:22
a 100% discount code to use it that was
0:24
devastating to Big Tech and especially
0:26
open AI who have been gradually trying
0:27
to convince people that AI is hard and
0:29
we need things like $500 billion
0:31
Stargate data centers now in order to
0:33
get the AI hype train back on track the
0:35
new White House aiar and PayPal Mafia
0:37
member David Sachs just went on the news
0:39
and said they have substantial evidence
0:41
that deep seek stole open ai's outputs
0:43
to fine-tune their models a technique
0:45
known as distillation that is strictly
0:47
forbidden in their terms of service the
0:49
irony here is not only palpable one
0:51
might describe it as artificial super
0:52
irony you might remember how open aai
0:54
vacuumed up the entire internet and all
0:56
its copyrighted materials without asking
0:58
anybody for permission Elon them of
1:00
scraping Twitter George RR Martin and a
1:02
bunch of other authors are suing among
1:03
many other lawsuits around the world but
1:05
I need to let you in on a tech bro
1:07
founder secret we do Shady stuff and
1:08
then ask for forgiveness later because
1:10
once a company reaches critical mass
1:12
there's no stopping it Uber and Airbnb
1:14
are prime examples and thus far open aai
1:16
has mostly prevailed in their copyright
1:18
infringement legal battles in today's
1:19
video we'll take a closer look at the
1:21
technical details of deep seek how it
1:23
bypassed Cuda and try to find out if it
1:25
actually ripped off open AI it is
1:27
January 29th 2025 and you're watching
1:29
the code report my conspiracy theory is
1:31
that open AI has been deep seek all
1:33
along and this was just the most genius
1:35
marketing trick of all time to assert
1:36
their dominance I wouldn't put it past
1:38
Chief persuasion officer Sam ultman he's
1:40
a he's a just a Kong man and he lies to
1:43
everyone but now open Ai and Microsoft
1:46
are accusing deep seek of distillation
1:48
where you take one big expensive model
1:49
like 01 and use its outputs to transfer
1:52
knowledge to a smaller model thus far
1:54
they haven't provided any hard evidence
1:55
but there are screenshots like this
1:57
going around the internet where deep
1:58
seek provides a response that should
2:00
only come from chat GPT that's not a
2:01
Smoking Gun though because this type of
2:03
content is all over the internet now is
2:05
so deep SE could have learned it
2:06
organically however Microsoft which
2:08
provides the servers for much of open
2:09
ai's compute is said they observe
2:11
someone in China extracting large
2:12
volumes of data from the open AI API and
2:15
they believe these accounts may be
2:16
linked to deep seek in other words deep
2:18
seek is basically Robin Hood stealing
2:19
from the rich to give to the poor the
2:21
distillation generally provides better
2:23
results compared to reinforcement
2:24
learning where you actually feed the
2:26
model new data with a reward function
2:27
distillation is not controversial and
2:29
deep has models distilled from llama and
2:31
quen in fact you can even distill open
2:33
AI models as long as you don't use the
2:35
API to build a rival model and that
2:37
appears to be the root of open ai's beef
2:39
and get this Alibaba just released quen
2:41
2.5 Max just minutes ago and although
2:43
it's not a reasoning model it's an open
2:45
model that beats deepseeker Claude and
2:47
GPT 40 on these benchmarks and not only
2:50
that but yet another Chinese model
2:51
called Kim 1.5 just came out and
2:54
apparently beats open AI 01 we're now in
2:56
a China versus China AI race with the
2:58
United States falling behind meanwhile
3:00
Europe is focused on other technological
3:02
innovations like bottle caps you can't
3:04
take off many people have complained
3:05
that deep seek is highly censored but
3:07
it's relatively easy to jailbreak if
3:08
you're a senior prompt engineer but
3:10
speaking of irony last year mid Journey
3:12
accused stability AI of image theft but
3:14
none of that matters now because deeps
3:16
also just released the Jan series models
3:18
which do diffusion based image
3:20
generation and while the quality is not
3:22
as good as stable diffusion or mid
3:23
Journey it's yet another open source
3:24
model you can use commercially and
3:26
that's good news for Humanity but
3:28
another interesting detail about deep
3:29
sea is that it achieved 10x better
3:31
efficiency than other models in part by
3:33
not using Cuda nvidia's proprietary
3:35
platform for running code on a GPU
3:37
instead they used Nvidia parallel thread
3:39
execution directly which conceptually
3:41
would be similar to building a website
3:42
with assembly code and is just another
3:44
example of how crack these deep seek
3:46
Engineers really are now another major
3:48
criticism of deep seek is that when you
3:49
use it on the web all your prompts data
3:51
and keystrokes go to China if you care
3:53
about privacy though you shouldn't be
3:54
using the internet anyway instead you
3:56
should use it locally like I did in this
3:57
video on my second Channel but the most
3:59
important Trend here is that open source
4:01

4:02
developer now is the time to start
4:04
building products people love and you
4:05
can do that with a truly awesome open
4:07
source tool called post hog the sponsor
4:09
of today's video it's like a Swiss army
4:11
knife to analyze test observe and deploy
4:14
better features its product Analytics
4:16
tool can help you understand your
4:17
customers and build funnels its web
4:19
analytics can replace Google analytics
4:21
and session replay will help you
4:23
understand how users actually interact
4:25
with your app not to mention feature
4:27
flags and UI experiments like AB test
4:30
just to name a few of the features but
4:31
most importantly it's easy to implement
4:33
thanks to sdks for web mobile and serers
4:36
side apps with excellent docs designed

# Did Deepseek R1 just pop the AI bubble?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl7aCUsWykg&t=1s


```python
0:00
last week Chinese company deep seek
0:02
shocked the world when they walked right
0:03
over open AI moe by releasing the open
0:06
source R1 model not only does it beat
0:08
their $200 01 reasoning model but it
0:10
also beats Claude Sonet in Gemini it
0:12
wins on key benchmarks but more
0:14
importantly it passes My Vibe test along
0:16
with many others on the internet as long
0:18
as you don't ask it what happened on
0:19
April 15th 1989 R1 even wins at math
0:22
which is crazy considering open AI had
0:24
the answers in advance over the last few
0:26
days normies have been learning about R1
0:28
and it went viral to become the number
0:29
one app America this is a big problem
0:31
for big Tech because in order for the
0:33
Griff to keep on grifting artificial
0:35
intelligence needs to be hard and take
0:36
thousands of gpus to pull off but deeps
0:39
R1 cost less than $10 million and was
0:41
actually the side project of a hedge
0:43
fund where their only goal is to create
0:44
long-term social value Wall Street is
0:46
terrified and Nvidia stock is in for a
0:48
blood bath today Nvidia has been the
0:50
primary beneficiary of the AI boom but
0:52
the whole bubble just got one-shotted by
0:54
a brutal reality check in today's video
0:56
we'll find out how deep seek just
0:57
changed the course of history it is
0:59
January 26 7 2025 and you're watching
1:01
the code report Big Tech is literally
1:03
shaking right now is Sam ultman coped
1:05
with a dramatic tweet a revolution can
1:07
neither be made nor stop the only thing
1:08
that can be done is for one of several
1:10
of its children to give it Direction by
1:12
Dent to victories I'm not sure if that's
1:14
Napoleon Dynamite or Napoleon boner part
1:16
but the funny thing is he damn near got
1:17
ratioed by someone with an anime profile
1:19
picture that said it's not that deep Bro
1:21
just release a better model in addition
1:23
to try to remain competitive with deep
1:25
seek open AI is also offering its 01
1:27
Mini model to free users but that's not
1:29
all they also Al released a new thing
1:30
called operator which gives AI access to
1:33
a browser and allows it to click on
1:34
buttons and fill out forms on your
1:36
behalf which is a game changer because
1:38
that means you can have chat GPT go
1:39
attend your court appointed DUI courses
1:41
or anything else you might have to do
1:43
online in the future humans will no
1:44
longer need websites or uis only apis
1:47
that can interact with the AIS operator
1:49
is currently only available to people on
1:50
the $200 plan and overall it gets pretty
1:53
mixed reviews that's cool and all but
1:54
the Chinese are really crushing it right
1:56
now deep seek is one thing but they also
1:58
released this thing called hun you on 3D
2:00
which can generate 3D meshes and
2:02
textures and that's huge for people like
2:03
me who have spent years failing to get
2:05
good at blender but the crazy thing
2:06
about deep seek is that it was just a
2:08
side project that cost very little money
2:10
to produce even Mark Andre called it one
2:12
of the most amazing and impressive
2:13
breakthroughs he's ever seen a profound
2:15
gift to the world and because of that
2:17
the stock market is panicking and just
2:18
wiped out nearly a trillion dollars in
2:20
value with Nvidia being The Biggest
2:22
Loser followed by other chip companies
2:24
like Taiwan semiconductor and broadcom
2:26
you see nvidia's had basically a
2:27
monopoly on AI training for the last
2:29
decade because they have better Linux
2:31
drivers than AMD and all the machine
2:33
learning algorithms are optimized for
2:34
libraries like Cuda which is proprietary
2:36
and can only run on Nvidia gpus and they
2:38
have the infrastructure to connect all
2:40
these gpus together at scale as AI
2:42
models get bigger and more popular is so
2:44
do the profits of Nvidia but someone got
2:46
deep seek running on a few Apple M2
2:48
Ultras and that's the 680 billion
2:50
parameter top-of-the-line model and
2:51
that's terrifying if you're a tech
2:53
investor pouring billions of dollars
2:54
into AI because if the best
2:55
state-of-the-art model can operate on
2:57
relatively cheap consumer hardware and
2:59
it's free and open source and developed
3:01
in China how are we going to make any
3:02
mother fing money people are calling
3:04
this the Sputnik moment when Russia
3:05
launched the first artificial satellite
3:07
into space in 1957 the United States was
3:09
shocked at the time and it took over a
3:11
decade to make a comeback when America
3:12
made its Pinnacle achievement of filming
3:14
a man on the moon in Nevada that's a
3:16
joke of course and even the smartest
3:17
technology in the world deep seek
3:19
believes in the moonlandings we had a
3:20
good run on this AI hype train but now
3:22
it's time to move on I'm looking forward
3:24
to brain chips quantum computers
3:25
artificial meat printers nanor robots
3:28
digital resurrection and tens of other
3:30
Tech that will make the world a better
3:31

# 1. Stargate

```python

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrHsw4Oja7w

0:00
open aai Oracle and SoftBank just
0:02
announced a massive deal with President
0:03
Trump called project Stargate despite
0:05
the name unfortunately this has nothing
0:07
to do with Intergalactic Wormhole
0:09
infrastructure their plan is to invest a
0:11
staggering $500 billion in the United
0:13
States to build the largest data centers
0:15
the world has ever seen for the sole
0:17
purpose of churning out AI slop to put
0:19
this number in perspective the US annual
0:21
defense budget is 850 billion but that
0:24
pays for aircraft carriers fighter jets
0:26
and space lasers but there was someone
0:27
who didn't get picked for the Stargate
0:29
team and he's feeling really bummed out
0:30
right now his name is Elon and everyone
0:32
seems to forget that he has an AI
0:34
company too he claims that SoftBank
0:36
doesn't actually have the money secured
0:38
and says the whole Stargate thing is
0:39
fake Sam ultman then came in with a
0:41
famous high road clapback where he
0:43
compliments Elon but says he's wrong and
0:44
then invites him to come visit the
0:46
project that's already underway then
0:47
Saia jumps in to backup Alman saying
0:49
he's good for his 80 billion I'm good
0:51
for my 80 billion in today's video we'll
0:53
find out what the Stargate project
0:54
really is and why you should be excited
0:56
but also terrified it is January 23rd
0:59
2025 and you're watching the code report
1:01
project Stargate is an AI infrastructure
1:03
project where the goal is to invest $500
1:05
billion in the United States to build
1:07
data centers now this project is not
1:09
actually funded by taxpayers but instead
1:11
will come from investors secured by the
1:13
Japanese Bank Soft Bank Moshi son is the
1:15
money guy Sam ultman is the gadgets guy
1:18
and Larry Ellison is the muscle these
1:19
data center facilities will require tons
1:21
of energy and Trump is the gas man who
1:23
will get that done by using executive
1:24
orders to divert power to get these
1:26
things built which they claim will
1:27
create 100,000 new jobs which will then
1:29
be eliminated by AI when they finish
1:31
building this thing on the bright side
1:32
this project could make AI cheaper and
1:34
more accessible and they're really
1:35
hyping up its medical benefits where
1:37
Larry Ellison said it will enable
1:38
personalized medicine for everyone and
1:40
that it should be able to develop
1:41
customized mRNA vaccines to cure cancer
1:44
Ellison is most welln as a champion
1:46
sailor but he also became one of the
1:47
richest men in the world by creating the
1:49
first commercial squl database he also
1:51
owns my favorite programming language
1:52
Java and is fighting a legal battle with
1:54
Dino to maintain control of the
1:56
JavaScript trademark but he also has a
1:58
dystopian vision for society where
1:59
everything is monitored by AI to keep
2:01
citizens on their best behavior citizens
2:03
will be on their best behavior because
2:06
we're constantly recording and Reporting
2:08
everything that's going on and we're
2:09
using AI to monitor the video this
2:11
Vision will become a reality in the very
2:13
near future Stargate currently has 10
2:15
data centers under construction in abene
2:17
Texas and is expanding to more States
2:19
soon and what's interesting is that the
2:20
government used to have a different
2:21
Stargate project back in the 70s which
2:23
was a top secret CIA project to explore
2:26
the possibility of psychic Warfare these
2:28
names are no accident Oracle sees the
2:29
future is Stargate is a portal to other
2:31
dimensions and open AI is the one who
2:33
gets to open the portal the timing is
2:35
perfect because after years of saying
2:37
open AI would definitely never go for
2:38
profit open AI just laid out plans to go
2:40
for-profit and give Sam Alman Equity to
2:43
make him billions of dollars richer and
2:44
that's surprising because he told
2:45
Congress in 2023 he was doing it because
2:47
he loves it make a lot of money do you I
2:50
I'm doing this because I love it Elon is
2:52
seething right now because he's about to
2:53
release grock 3 which is a reasoning
2:55
model like deep seek or 01 and based on
2:58
this one biased example could be
2:59
Superior to those models now I might get
3:01
in trouble with my Illuminati Handler
3:03
for telling you this but all this drama
3:04
and beefing is scripted and fake Elon
3:06
and Alman are Bros who started open AI
3:08
together Ellison helped Elon by Twitter
3:10
they're all connected to the PayPal
3:11
Mafia and Peter theal whose Protege JD
3:14
Vance just became the vice president
3:15
he'll take over as president in 2027 but
3:17
is actually controlled by reptilians who
3:19
have been alive since the Roman times
3:20
all roads lead to Rome and that's why
3:22
Elon did this autistic Roman salute
3:24
recently to Mark the beginning of the
3:25
tech bro Dynasty that will reign supreme
3:27
for the next 500 years this has been the
3:29

# Deepseek - Disruptor Detected :)


Did DeepSeek R1 just pop the AI bubble?

Nope, just made the big bubble into hundreds of big bubbles as new engineers around the world understand the GRPO aha moments and new insight on RL at scale.  It does make it open for the world though.  Good times for freedom of information but maybe bad for those who felt they had the drop on all ways to reach ASI.  For world democracy and really world partnership it helps us get out of the 'one world leader' mindset and more rightly places emphasis on world knowledge.  Truly beginning of a golden age of AI and maybe also information and knowledge sharing creating truly open world knowledge.  I feel very appreciative, and hopefully this makes the world a less fearful, more performant together world AI super-organization..  ASI could be distributed and for all humanity.

In the context of reinforcement learning, GRPO stands for Generalized Reward-Policy Optimization](https://x.com/i/grok?text=ptimization)). GRPO is an algorithm designed to optimize both the reward function and the policy simultaneously. Here's a brief explanation:

Reward Function: In reinforcement learning, the reward function defines what the agent should strive to achieve. Traditionally, this function is assumed to be known or fixed, but in many real-world scenarios, it might not perfectly capture the desired behavior or might be unknown.
Policy: This is the strategy or behavior the agent learns to maximize the cumulative reward over time. 
Optimization: GRPO works by jointly optimizing the reward function and the policy. This approach allows the system to adapt both elements when one or both might be misaligned or imperfectly defined from the start.

GRPO can be particularly useful in scenarios where:
The reward signal is sparse or noisy.
The true objective of the task is not well-defined or changes over time.
There's a need to learn from human feedback or preferences which might not directly translate into a clear reward function.

The algorithm typically involves:
An iterative process where both the reward function and the policy are updated in each iteration.
Using techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or preference-based learning to refine the reward function based on observed behaviors or feedback.
Employing policy gradient methods or other RL algorithms to update the policy while simultaneously adjusting the reward function to better reflect the true task goal.

GRPO, or Generalized Reward-Policy Optimization, in reinforcement learning üß†, involves tweaking both the reward function üéØ and the policy üìä together. This method helps when the goals are unclear or change, making the learning process more flexible and effective. üõ†Ô∏èüîÑ

This code demonstrates a basic Streamlit app for a Self Reward AI system. The self_evaluate function should be replaced with the actual implementation of the self-evaluation logic, which could involve techniques like reinforcement learning, self-supervision, and metacognition. The display_results function displays the AI output, self-evaluation score, and self-feedback to the user.

üìÑ Principle-Driven Self-Alignment of Language Models from Scratch with Minimal Human Supervision
### 02 Dec 2023 | Principle-Driven Self-Alignment of Language Models from Scratch with Minimal Human Supervision ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Zhiqing Sun, Yikang Shen, Qinhong Zhou, Hongxin Zhang, Zhenfang Chen, David Cox, Yiming Yang, Chuang Gan

Recent AI-assistant agents, such as ChatGPT, predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human annotations and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align the output of large language models (LLMs) with human intentions, ensuring they are helpful, ethical, and reliable. However, this dependence can significantly constrain the true potential of AI-assistant agents due to the high cost of obtaining human supervision and the related issues on quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power of LLMs for the self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision. Our approach encompasses four stages: first, we use an LLM to generate synthetic prompts, and a topic-guided method to augment the prompt diversity; second, we use a small set of human-written principles for AI models to follow, and guide the LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations (of principles application) to produce helpful, ethical, and reliable responses to user's queries; third, we fine-tune the original LLM with the high-quality self-aligned responses so that the resulting model can generate desirable responses for each query directly without the principle set and the demonstrations anymore; and finally, we offer a refinement step to address the issues of overly-brief or indirect responses. Applying SELF-ALIGN to the LLaMA-65b base language model, we develop an AI assistant named Dromedary. With fewer than 300 lines of human annotations (including < 200 seed prompts, 16 generic principles, and 5 exemplars for in-context learning). Dromedary significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including Text-Davinci-003 and Alpaca, on benchmark datasets with various settings. ---------------


üìÑ Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback
### 15 Dec 2022 | Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Bowman, Zac Hatfield-Dodds, Ben Mann, Dario Amodei, Nicholas Joseph, Sam McCandlish, Tom Brown, Jared Kaplan

As AI systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other AIs. We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels. ---------------


üìÑ SALMON: Self-Alignment with Principle-Following Reward Models
### 09 Oct 2023 | SALMON: Self-Alignment with Principle-Following Reward Models ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Zhiqing Sun, Yikang Shen, Hongxin Zhang, Qinhong Zhou, Zhenfang Chen, David Cox, Yiming Yang, Chuang Gan

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on response demonstrations combined with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) constitutes a powerful paradigm for aligning LLM-based AI agents. However, a significant limitation of such an approach is its dependency on high-quality human annotations, making its application to intricate tasks challenging due to difficulties in obtaining consistent response demonstrations and in-distribution response preferences. This paper presents a novel approach, namely SALMON (Self-ALignMent with principle-fOllowiNg reward models), to align base language models with minimal human supervision, using only a small set of human-defined principles, yet achieving superior performance. Central to our approach is a principle-following reward model. Trained on synthetic preference data, this model can generate reward scores based on arbitrary human-defined principles. By merely adjusting these principles during the RL training phase, we gain full control over the preferences with the reward model, subsequently influencing the behavior of the RL-trained policies, and eliminating the reliance on the collection of online human preferences. Applying our method to the LLaMA-2-70b base language model, we developed an AI assistant named Dromedary-2. With only 6 exemplars for in-context learning and 31 human-defined principles, Dromedary-2 significantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including LLaMA-2-Chat-70b, on various benchmark datasets. We have open-sourced the code and model weights to encourage further research into aligning LLM-based AI agents with enhanced supervision efficiency, improved controllability, and scalable oversight. ---------------


üìÑ The MineRL BASALT Competition on Learning from Human Feedback
### 05 Jul 2021 | The MineRL BASALT Competition on Learning from Human Feedback ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Rohin Shah, Cody Wild, Steven H. Wang, Neel Alex, Brandon Houghton, William Guss, Sharada Mohanty, Anssi Kanervisto, Stephanie Milani, Nicholay Topin, Pieter Abbeel, Stuart Russell, Anca Dragan

The last decade has seen a significant increase of interest in deep learning research, with many public successes that have demonstrated its potential. As such, these systems are now being incorporated into commercial products. With this comes an additional challenge: how can we build AI systems that solve tasks where there is not a crisp, well-defined specification? While multiple solutions have been proposed, in this competition we focus on one in particular: learning from human feedback. Rather than training AI systems using a predefined reward function or using a labeled dataset with a predefined set of categories, we instead train the AI system using a learning signal derived from some form of human feedback, which can evolve over time as the understanding of the task changes, or as the capabilities of the AI system improve. The MineRL BASALT competition aims to spur forward research on this important class of techniques. We design a suite of four tasks in Minecraft for which we expect it will be hard to write down hardcoded reward functions. These tasks are defined by a paragraph of natural language: for example, "create a waterfall and take a scenic picture of it", with additional clarifying details. Participants must train a separate agent for each task, using any method they want. Agents are then evaluated by humans who have read the task description. To help participants get started, we provide a dataset of human demonstrations on each of the four tasks, as well as an imitation learning baseline that leverages these demonstrations. Our hope is that this competition will improve our ability to build AI systems that do what their designers intend them to do, even when the intent cannot be easily formalized. Besides allowing AI to solve more tasks, this can also enable more effective regulation of AI systems, as well as making progress on the value alignment problem. ---------------


üìÑ CodeIt: Self-Improving Language Models with Prioritized Hindsight Replay
### 07 Feb 2024 | CodeIt: Self-Improving Language Models with Prioritized Hindsight Replay ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Natasha Butt, Blazej Manczak, Auke Wiggers, Corrado Rainone, David Zhang, Micha"el Defferrard, Taco Cohen

Large language models are increasingly solving tasks that are commonly believed to require human-level reasoning ability. However, these models still perform very poorly on benchmarks of general intelligence such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this paper, we approach ARC as a programming-by-examples problem, and introduce a novel and scalable method for language model self-improvement called Code Iteration (CodeIt). Our method iterates between 1) program sampling and hindsight relabeling, and 2) learning from prioritized experience replay. By relabeling the goal of an episode (i.e., the target program output given input) to the realized output produced by the sampled program, our method effectively deals with the extreme sparsity of rewards in program synthesis. Applying CodeIt to the ARC dataset, we demonstrate that prioritized hindsight replay, along with pre-training and data-augmentation, leads to successful inter-task generalization. CodeIt is the first neuro-symbolic approach that scales to the full ARC evaluation dataset. Our method solves 15% of ARC evaluation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing neural and symbolic baselines. ---------------

With LLMs shifting their role from statistical modeling of language to serving as general-purpose AI agents, how should LLM evaluations change? Arguably, a key ability of an AI agent is to flexibly combine, as needed, the basic skills it has learned. The capability to combine skills plays an important role in (human) pedagogy and also in a paper on emergence phenomena (Arora & Goyal, 2023). This work introduces Skill-Mix, a new evaluation to measure ability to combine skills. Using a list of 
N
N skills the evaluator repeatedly picks random subsets of 
k
k skills and asks the LLM to produce text combining that subset of skills. Since the number of subsets grows like 
N
k
N 
k
 , for even modest 
k
k this evaluation will, with high probability, require the LLM to produce text significantly different from any text in the training set. The paper develops a methodology for (a) designing and administering such an evaluation, and (b) automatic grading (plus spot-checking by humans) of the results using GPT-4 as well as the open LLaMA-2 70B model. Administering a version of to popular chatbots gave results that, while generally in line with prior expectations, contained surprises. Sizeable differences exist among model capabilities that are not captured by their ranking on popular LLM leaderboards ("cramming for the leaderboard"). Furthermore, simple probability calculations indicate that GPT-4's reasonable performance on 
k
=
5
k=5 is suggestive of going beyond "stochastic parrot" behavior (Bender et al., 2021), i.e., it combines skills in ways that it had not seen during training. We sketch how the methodology can lead to a Skill-Mix based eco-system of open evaluations for AI capabilities of future models. ---------------


üìÑ Masked Diffusion with Task-awareness for Procedure Planning in Instructional Videos
### 14 Sep 2023 | Masked Diffusion with Task-awareness for Procedure Planning in Instructional Videos ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Fen Fang, Yun Liu, Ali Koksal, Qianli Xu, Joo-Hwee Lim

A key challenge with procedure planning in instructional videos lies in how to handle a large decision space consisting of a multitude of action types that belong to various tasks. To understand real-world video content, an AI agent must proficiently discern these action types (e.g., pour milk, pour water, open lid, close lid, etc.) based on brief visual observation. Moreover, it must adeptly capture the intricate semantic relation of the action types and task goals, along with the variable action sequences. Recently, notable progress has been made via the integration of diffusion models and visual representation learning to address the challenge. However, existing models employ rudimentary mechanisms to utilize task information to manage the decision space. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a simple yet effective enhancement - a masked diffusion model. The introduced mask acts akin to a task-oriented attention filter, enabling the diffusion/denoising process to concentrate on a subset of action types. Furthermore, to bolster the accuracy of task classification, we harness more potent visual representation learning techniques. In particular, we learn a joint visual-text embedding, where a text embedding is generated by prompting a pre-trained vision-language model to focus on human actions. We evaluate the method on three public datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/ffzzy840304/Masked-PDPP. ---------------


üìÑ Selective Visual Representations Improve Convergence and Generalization for Embodied AI
### 07 Nov 2023 | Selective Visual Representations Improve Convergence and Generalization for Embodied AI ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Ainaz Eftekhar, Kuo-Hao Zeng, Jiafei Duan, Ali Farhadi, Ani Kembhavi, Ranjay Krishna

Embodied AI models often employ off the shelf vision backbones like CLIP to encode their visual observations. Although such general purpose representations encode rich syntactic and semantic information about the scene, much of this information is often irrelevant to the specific task at hand. This introduces noise within the learning process and distracts the agent's focus from task-relevant visual cues. Inspired by selective attention in humans-the process through which people filter their perception based on their experiences, knowledge, and the task at hand-we introduce a parameter-efficient approach to filter visual stimuli for embodied AI. Our approach induces a task-conditioned bottleneck using a small learnable codebook module. This codebook is trained jointly to optimize task reward and acts as a task-conditioned selective filter over the visual observation. Our experiments showcase state-of-the-art performance for object goal navigation and object displacement across 5 benchmarks, ProcTHOR, ArchitecTHOR, RoboTHOR, AI2-iTHOR, and ManipulaTHOR. The filtered representations produced by the codebook are also able generalize better and converge faster when adapted to other simulation environments such as Habitat. Our qualitative analyses show that agents explore their environments more effectively and their representations retain task-relevant information like target object recognition while ignoring superfluous information about other objects. Code and pretrained models are available at our project website: https://embodied-codebook.github.io. ---------------


üìÑ Foundation Models for Natural Language Processing -- Pre-trained Language Models Integrating Media
### 16 Feb 2023 | Foundation Models for Natural Language Processing -- Pre-trained Language Models Integrating Media ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Gerhard Paa{\ss} and Sven Giesselbach

This open access book provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in research and applications of Foundation Models and is intended for readers familiar with basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. Over the recent years, a revolutionary new paradigm has been developed for training models for NLP. These models are first pre-trained on large collections of text documents to acquire general syntactic knowledge and semantic information. Then, they are fine-tuned for specific tasks, which they can often solve with superhuman accuracy. When the models are large enough, they can be instructed by prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be applied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from image and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a blueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been called Foundation Models. After a brief introduction to basic NLP models the main pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer are described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive embedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed, such as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input texts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models for about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering, translation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text, etc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models are discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given. In addition, links are provided to freely available program code. A concluding chapter summarizes the economic opportunities, mitigation of risks, and potential developments of AI. ---------------


üìÑ Automating Human Tutor-Style Programming Feedback: Leveraging GPT-4 Tutor Model for Hint Generation and GPT-3.5 Student Model for Hint Validation
### 21 Dec 2023 | Automating Human Tutor-Style Programming Feedback: Leveraging GPT-4 Tutor Model for Hint Generation and GPT-3.5 Student Model for Hint Validation ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Tung Phung, Victor-Alexandru P\u{a}durean, Anjali Singh, Christopher Brooks, Jos'e Cambronero, Sumit Gulwani, Adish Singla, Gustavo Soares

Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing programming education by automatically generating individualized feedback for students. We investigate the role of generative AI models in providing human tutor-style programming hints to help students resolve errors in their buggy programs. Recent works have benchmarked state-of-the-art models for various feedback generation scenarios; however, their overall quality is still inferior to human tutors and not yet ready for real-world deployment. In this paper, we seek to push the limits of generative AI models toward providing high-quality programming hints and develop a novel technique, GPT4Hints-GPT3.5Val. As a first step, our technique leverages GPT-4 as a tutor'' model to generate hints -- it boosts the generative quality by using symbolic information of failing test cases and fixes in prompts. As a next step, our technique leverages GPT-3.5, a weaker model, as a student'' model to further validate the hint quality ‚Äî it performs an automatic quality validation by simulating the potential utility of providing this feedback. We show the efficacy of our technique via extensive evaluation using three real-world datasets of Python programs covering a variety of concepts ranging from basic algorithms to regular expressions and data analysis using pandas library. ---------------


üìÑ STEVE-1: A Generative Model for Text-to-Behavior in Minecraft
### 04 Feb 2024 | STEVE-1: A Generative Model for Text-to-Behavior in Minecraft ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Shalev Lifshitz, Keiran Paster, Harris Chan, Jimmy Ba, Sheila McIlraith

Constructing AI models that respond to text instructions is challenging, especially for sequential decision-making tasks. This work introduces a methodology, inspired by unCLIP, for instruction-tuning generative models of behavior without relying on a large dataset of instruction-labeled trajectories. Using this methodology, we create an instruction-tuned Video Pretraining (VPT) model called STEVE-1, which can follow short-horizon open-ended text and visual instructions in Minecraft. STEVE-1 is trained in two steps: adapting the pretrained VPT model to follow commands in MineCLIP's latent space, then training a prior to predict latent codes from text. This allows us to finetune VPT through self-supervised behavioral cloning and hindsight relabeling, reducing the need for costly human text annotations, and all for only $60 of compute. By leveraging pretrained models like VPT and MineCLIP and employing best practices from text-conditioned image generation, STEVE-1 sets a new bar for open-ended instruction-following in Minecraft with low-level controls (mouse and keyboard) and raw pixel inputs, far outperforming previous baselines and robustly completing 12 of 13 tasks in our early-game evaluation suite. We provide experimental evidence highlighting key factors for downstream performance, including pretraining, classifier-free guidance, and data scaling. All resources, including our model weights, training scripts, and evaluation tools are made available for further research. ---------------


üìÑ Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Self-Predictive Representations
### 20 May 2021 | Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Self-Predictive Representations ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Max Schwarzer, Ankesh Anand, Rishab Goel, R Devon Hjelm, Aaron Courville, Philip Bachman

While deep reinforcement learning excels at solving tasks where large amounts of data can be collected through virtually unlimited interaction with the environment, learning from limited interaction remains a key challenge. We posit that an agent can learn more efficiently if we augment reward maximization with self-supervised objectives based on structure in its visual input and sequential interaction with the environment. Our method, Self-Predictive Representations(SPR), trains an agent to predict its own latent state representations multiple steps into the future. We compute target representations for future states using an encoder which is an exponential moving average of the agent's parameters and we make predictions using a learned transition model. On its own, this future prediction objective outperforms prior methods for sample-efficient deep RL from pixels. We further improve performance by adding data augmentation to the future prediction loss, which forces the agent's representations to be consistent across multiple views of an observation. Our full self-supervised objective, which combines future prediction and data augmentation, achieves a median human-normalized score of 0.415 on Atari in a setting limited to 100k steps of environment interaction, which represents a 55% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art. Notably, even in this limited data regime, SPR exceeds expert human scores on 7 out of 26 games. The code associated with this work is available at https://github.com/mila-iqia/spr ---------------


üìÑ Learning Invariant World State Representations with Predictive Coding
### 06 Jul 2022 | Learning Invariant World State Representations with Predictive Coding ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Avi Ziskind, Sujeong Kim, and Giedrius T. Burachas

Self-supervised learning methods overcome the key bottleneck for building more capable AI: limited availability of labeled data. However, one of the drawbacks of self-supervised architectures is that the representations that they learn are implicit and it is hard to extract meaningful information about the encoded world states, such as 3D structure of the visual scene encoded in a depth map. Moreover, in the visual domain such representations only rarely undergo evaluations that may be critical for downstream tasks, such as vision for autonomous cars. Herein, we propose a framework for evaluating visual representations for illumination invariance in the context of depth perception. We develop a new predictive coding-based architecture and a hybrid fully-supervised/self-supervised learning method. We propose a novel architecture that extends the predictive coding approach: PRedictive Lateral bottom-Up and top-Down Encoder-decoder Network (PreludeNet), which explicitly learns to infer and predict depth from video frames. In PreludeNet, the encoder's stack of predictive coding layers is trained in a self-supervised manner, while the predictive decoder is trained in a supervised manner to infer or predict the depth. We evaluate the robustness of our model on a new synthetic dataset, in which lighting conditions (such as overall illumination, and effect of shadows) can be be parametrically adjusted while keeping all other aspects of the world constant. PreludeNet achieves both competitive depth inference performance and next frame prediction accuracy. We also show how this new network architecture, coupled with the hybrid fully-supervised/self-supervised learning method, achieves balance between the said performance and invariance to changes in lighting. The proposed framework for evaluating visual representations can be extended to diverse task domains and invariance tests. ---------------


üìÑ State2Explanation: Concept-Based Explanations to Benefit Agent Learning and User Understanding
### 10 Nov 2023 | State2Explanation: Concept-Based Explanations to Benefit Agent Learning and User Understanding ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Devleena Das, Sonia Chernova, Been Kim

As more non-AI experts use complex AI systems for daily tasks, there has been an increasing effort to develop methods that produce explanations of AI decision making that are understandable by non-AI experts. Towards this effort, leveraging higher-level concepts and producing concept-based explanations have become a popular method. Most concept-based explanations have been developed for classification techniques, and we posit that the few existing methods for sequential decision making are limited in scope. In this work, we first contribute a desiderata for defining concepts in sequential decision making settings. Additionally, inspired by the Protege Effect which states explaining knowledge often reinforces one's self-learning, we explore how concept-based explanations of an RL agent's decision making can in turn improve the agent's learning rate, as well as improve end-user understanding of the agent's decision making. To this end, we contribute a unified framework, State2Explanation (S2E), that involves learning a joint embedding model between state-action pairs and concept-based explanations, and leveraging such learned model to both (1) inform reward shaping during an agent's training, and (2) provide explanations to end-users at deployment for improved task performance. Our experimental validations, in Connect 4 and Lunar Lander, demonstrate the success of S2E in providing a dual-benefit, successfully informing reward shaping and improving agent learning rate, as well as significantly improving end user task performance at deployment time. ---------------


üìÑ LeTI: Learning to Generate from Textual Interactions
### 17 May 2023 | LeTI: Learning to Generate from Textual Interactions ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Xingyao Wang, Hao Peng, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand, Heng Ji

Finetuning pre-trained language models (LMs) enhances the models' capabilities. Prior techniques fine-tune a pre-trained LM on input-output pairs (e.g., instruction fine-tuning), or with numerical rewards that gauge the quality of its outputs (e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback). We explore LMs' potential to learn from textual interactions (LeTI) that not only check their correctness with binary labels, but also pinpoint and explain errors in their outputs through textual feedback. Our investigation focuses on the code generation task, where the model produces code pieces in response to natural language instructions. This setting invites a natural and scalable way to acquire the textual feedback: the error messages and stack traces from code execution using a Python interpreter. LeTI iteratively fine-tunes the model, using the LM objective, on a concatenation of natural language instructions, LM-generated programs, and textual feedback, which is only provided when the generated program fails to solve the task. Prepended to this fine-tuning text, a binary reward token is used to differentiate correct and buggy solutions. On MBPP, a code generation dataset, LeTI substantially improves the performance of two base LMs of different scales. LeTI requires no ground-truth outputs for training and even outperforms a fine-tuned baseline that does. LeTI's strong performance generalizes to other datasets. Trained on MBPP, it achieves comparable or better performance than the base LMs on unseen problems in HumanEval. Furthermore, compared to binary feedback, we observe that textual feedback leads to improved generation quality and sample efficiency, achieving the same performance with fewer than half of the gradient steps. LeTI is equally applicable in natural language tasks when they can be formulated as code generation, which we empirically verified on event argument extraction. ---------------


üìÑ A General Purpose Supervisory Signal for Embodied Agents
### 01 Dec 2022 | A General Purpose Supervisory Signal for Embodied Agents ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Kunal Pratap Singh, Jordi Salvador, Luca Weihs, Aniruddha Kembhavi

Training effective embodied AI agents often involves manual reward engineering, expert imitation, specialized components such as maps, or leveraging additional sensors for depth and localization. Another approach is to use neural architectures alongside self-supervised objectives which encourage better representation learning. In practice, there are few guarantees that these self-supervised objectives encode task-relevant information. We propose the Scene Graph Contrastive (SGC) loss, which uses scene graphs as general-purpose, training-only, supervisory signals. The SGC loss does away with explicit graph decoding and instead uses contrastive learning to align an agent's representation with a rich graphical encoding of its environment. The SGC loss is generally applicable, simple to implement, and encourages representations that encode objects' semantics, relationships, and history. Using the SGC loss, we attain significant gains on three embodied tasks: Object Navigation, Multi-Object Navigation, and Arm Point Navigation. Finally, we present studies and analyses which demonstrate the ability of our trained representation to encode semantic cues about the environment. ---------------


üìÑ RAMario: Experimental Approach to Reptile Algorithm -- Reinforcement Learning for Mario
### 16 May 2023 | RAMario: Experimental Approach to Reptile Algorithm -- Reinforcement Learning for Mario ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Sanyam Jain

This research paper presents an experimental approach to using the Reptile algorithm for reinforcement learning to train a neural network to play Super Mario Bros. We implement the Reptile algorithm using the Super Mario Bros Gym library and TensorFlow in Python, creating a neural network model with a single convolutional layer, a flatten layer, and a dense layer. We define the optimizer and use the Reptile class to create an instance of the Reptile meta-learning algorithm. We train the model using multiple tasks and episodes, choosing actions using the current weights of the neural network model, taking those actions in the environment, and updating the model weights using the Reptile algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by printing the total reward for each episode. In addition, we compare the performance of the Reptile algorithm approach to two other popular reinforcement learning algorithms, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Network (DQN), applied to the same Super Mario Bros task. Our results demonstrate that the Reptile algorithm provides a promising approach to few-shot learning in video game AI, with comparable or even better performance than the other two algorithms, particularly in terms of moves vs distance that agent performs for 1M episodes of training. The results shows that best total distance for world 1-2 in the game environment were ~1732 (PPO), ~1840 (DQN) and ~2300 (RAMario).

üìÑ Pair Programming with Large Language Models for Sampling and Estimation of Copulas
### 31 Mar 2023 | Pair Programming with Large Language Models for Sampling and Estimation of Copulas ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Jan G'orecki

Without writing a single line of code by a human, an example Monte Carlo simulation based application for stochastic dependence modeling with copulas is developed using a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for conversations. This includes interaction with ChatGPT in natural language and using mathematical formalism, which, under careful supervision by a human-expert, led to producing a working code in MATLAB, Python and R for sampling from a given copula model, evaluation of the model's density, performing maximum likelihood estimation, optimizing the code for parallel computing for CPUs as well as for GPUs, and visualization of the computed results. In contrast to other emerging studies that assess the accuracy of LLMs like ChatGPT on tasks from a selected area, this work rather investigates ways how to achieve a successful solution of a standard statistical task in a collaboration of a human-expert and artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly, through careful prompt engineering, we separate successful solutions generated by ChatGPT from unsuccessful ones, resulting in a comprehensive list of related pros and cons. It is demonstrated that if the typical pitfalls are avoided, we can substantially benefit from collaborating with an AI partner. For example, we show that if ChatGPT is not able to provide a correct solution due to a lack of or incorrect knowledge, the human-expert can feed it with the correct knowledge, e.g., in the form of mathematical theorems and formulas, and make it to apply the gained knowledge in order to provide a solution that is correct. Such ability presents an attractive opportunity to achieve a programmed solution even for users with rather limited knowledge of programming techniques. ---------------


üìÑ AssistGPT: A General Multi-modal Assistant that can Plan, Execute, Inspect, and Learn

Authors: Difei Gao, Lei Ji, Luowei Zhou, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Joya Chen, Zihan Fan, Mike Zheng Shou

Recent research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to remarkable advancements in general NLP AI assistants. Some studies have further explored the use of LLMs for planning and invoking models or APIs to address more general multi-modal user queries. Despite this progress, complex visual-based tasks still remain challenging due to the diverse nature of visual tasks. This diversity is reflected in two aspects: 1) Reasoning paths. For many real-life applications, it is hard to accurately decompose a query simply by examining the query itself. Planning based on the specific visual content and the results of each step is usually required. 2) Flexible inputs and intermediate results. Input forms could be flexible for in-the-wild cases, and involves not only a single image or video but a mixture of videos and images, e.g., a user-view image with some reference videos. Besides, a complex reasoning process will also generate diverse multimodal intermediate results, e.g., video narrations, segmented video clips, etc. To address such general cases, we propose a multi-modal AI assistant, AssistGPT, with an interleaved code and language reasoning approach called Plan, Execute, Inspect, and Learn (PEIL) to integrate LLMs with various tools. Specifically, the Planner is capable of using natural language to plan which tool in Executor should do next based on the current reasoning progress. Inspector is an efficient memory manager to assist the Planner to feed proper visual information into a specific tool. Finally, since the entire reasoning process is complex and flexible, a Learner is designed to enable the model to autonomously explore and discover the optimal solution. We conducted experiments on A-OKVQA and NExT-QA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Moreover, showcases demonstrate the ability of our system to handle questions far more complex than those found in the benchmarks. ---------------


üìÑ Feedback-Based Self-Learning in Large-Scale Conversational AI Agents
### 06 Nov 2019 | Feedback-Based Self-Learning in Large-Scale Conversational AI Agents ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Pragaash Ponnusamy, Alireza Roshan Ghias, Chenlei Guo, Ruhi Sarikaya

Today, most large-scale conversational AI agents (e.g. Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant) are built using manually annotated data to train the different components of the system. Typically, the accuracy of the ML models in these components are improved by manually transcribing and annotating data. As the scope of these systems increase to cover more scenarios and domains, manual annotation to improve the accuracy of these components becomes prohibitively costly and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages user-system interaction feedback signals to automate learning without any manual annotation. Users here tend to modify a previous query in hopes of fixing an error in the previous turn to get the right results. These reformulations, which are often preceded by defective experiences caused by errors in ASR, NLU, ER or the application. In some cases, users may not properly formulate their requests (e.g. providing partial title of a song), but gleaning across a wider pool of users and sessions reveals the underlying recurrent patterns. Our proposed self-learning system automatically detects the errors, generate reformulations and deploys fixes to the runtime system to correct different types of errors occurring in different components of the system. In particular, we propose leveraging an absorbing Markov Chain model as a collaborative filtering mechanism in a novel attempt to mine these patterns. We show that our approach is highly scalable, and able to learn reformulations that reduce Alexa-user errors by pooling anonymized data across millions of customers. The proposed self-learning system achieves a win/loss ratio of 11.8 and effectively reduces the defect rate by more than 30% on utterance level reformulations in our production A/B tests. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-learning large-scale conversational AI system in production. ---------------

üìÑ UPB at SemEval-2020 Task 6: Pretrained Language Models for Definition Extraction
### 16 Sep 2020 | UPB at SemEval-2020 Task 6: Pretrained Language Models for Definition Extraction ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Andrei-Marius Avram, Dumitru-Clementin Cercel, Costin-Gabriel Chiru

This work presents our contribution in the context of the 6th task of SemEval-2020: Extracting Definitions from Free Text in Textbooks (DeftEval). This competition consists of three subtasks with different levels of granularity: (1) classification of sentences as definitional or non-definitional,(2) labeling of definitional sentences, and (3) relation classification. We use various pretrained language models (i.e., BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, SciBERT, and ALBERT) to solve each of the three subtasks of the competition. Specifically, for each language model variant, we experiment by both freezing its weights and fine-tuning them. We also explore a multi-task architecture that was trained to jointly predict the outputs for the second and the third subtasks. Our best performing model evaluated on the DeftEval dataset obtains the 32nd place for the first subtask and the 37th place for the second subtask. The code is available for further research at: https://github.com/avramandrei/DeftEval. ---------------


üìÑ Query and Output: Generating Words by Querying Distributed Word Representations for Paraphrase Generation
### 30 Mar 2018 | Query and Output: Generating Words by Querying Distributed Word Representations for Paraphrase Generation ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Shuming Ma, Xu Sun, Wei Li, Sujian Li, Wenjie Li, Xuancheng Ren

Most recent approaches use the sequence-to-sequence model for paraphrase generation. The existing sequence-to-sequence model tends to memorize the words and the patterns in the training dataset instead of learning the meaning of the words. Therefore, the generated sentences are often grammatically correct but semantically improper. In this work, we introduce a novel model based on the encoder-decoder framework, called Word Embedding Attention Network (WEAN). Our proposed model generates the words by querying distributed word representations (i.e. neural word embeddings), hoping to capturing the meaning of the according words. Following previous work, we evaluate our model on two paraphrase-oriented tasks, namely text simplification and short text abstractive summarization. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the sequence-to-sequence baseline by the BLEU score of 6.3 and 5.5 on two English text simplification datasets, and the ROUGE-2 F1 score of 5.7 on a Chinese summarization dataset. Moreover, our model achieves state-of-the-art performances on these three benchmark datasets. ---------------


üìÑ Sentence, Phrase, and Triple Annotations to Build a Knowledge Graph of Natural Language Processing Contributions -- A Trial Dataset
### 07 May 2021 | Sentence, Phrase, and Triple Annotations to Build a Knowledge Graph of Natural Language Processing Contributions -- A Trial Dataset ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Jennifer D'Souza, S"oren Auer

Purpose: The aim of this work is to normalize the NLPCONTRIBUTIONS scheme (henceforward, NLPCONTRIBUTIONGRAPH) to structure, directly from article sentences, the contributions information in Natural Language Processing (NLP) scholarly articles via a two-stage annotation methodology: 1) pilot stage - to define the scheme (described in prior work); and 2) adjudication stage - to normalize the graphing model (the focus of this paper). Design/methodology/approach: We re-annotate, a second time, the contributions-pertinent information across 50 prior-annotated NLP scholarly articles in terms of a data pipeline comprising: contribution-centered sentences, phrases, and triple statements. To this end, specifically, care was taken in the adjudication annotation stage to reduce annotation noise while formulating the guidelines for our proposed novel NLP contributions structuring and graphing scheme. Findings: The application of NLPCONTRIBUTIONGRAPH on the 50 articles resulted finally in a dataset of 900 contribution-focused sentences, 4,702 contribution-information-centered phrases, and 2,980 surface-structured triples. The intra-annotation agreement between the first and second stages, in terms of F1, was 67.92% for sentences, 41.82% for phrases, and 22.31% for triple statements indicating that with increased granularity of the information, the annotation decision variance is greater. Practical Implications: We demonstrate NLPCONTRIBUTIONGRAPH data integrated into the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), a next-generation KG-based digital library with intelligent computations enabled over structured scholarly knowledge, as a viable aid to assist researchers in their day-to-day tasks. ---------------


üìÑ Generating SOAP Notes from Doctor-Patient Conversations Using Modular Summarization Techniques
### 02 Jun 2021 | Generating SOAP Notes from Doctor-Patient Conversations Using Modular Summarization Techniques ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Kundan Krishna, Sopan Khosla, Jeffrey P. Bigham, Zachary C. Lipton

Following each patient visit, physicians draft long semi-structured clinical summaries called SOAP notes. While invaluable to clinicians and researchers, creating digital SOAP notes is burdensome, contributing to physician burnout. In this paper, we introduce the first complete pipelines to leverage deep summarization models to generate these notes based on transcripts of conversations between physicians and patients. After exploring a spectrum of methods across the extractive-abstractive spectrum, we propose Cluster2Sent, an algorithm that (i) extracts important utterances relevant to each summary section; (ii) clusters together related utterances; and then (iii) generates one summary sentence per cluster. Cluster2Sent outperforms its purely abstractive counterpart by 8 ROUGE-1 points, and produces significantly more factual and coherent sentences as assessed by expert human evaluators. For reproducibility, we demonstrate similar benefits on the publicly available AMI dataset. Our results speak to the benefits of structuring summaries into sections and annotating supporting evidence when constructing summarization corpora. ---------------


üìÑ Multilevel Text Normalization with Sequence-to-Sequence Networks and Multisource Learning
### 29 Mar 2019 | Multilevel Text Normalization with Sequence-to-Sequence Networks and Multisource Learning ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Tatyana Ruzsics and Tanja Samard\v{z}i'c

We define multilevel text normalization as sequence-to-sequence processing that transforms naturally noisy text into a sequence of normalized units of meaning (morphemes) in three steps: 1) writing normalization, 2) lemmatization, 3) canonical segmentation. These steps are traditionally considered separate NLP tasks, with diverse solutions, evaluation schemes and data sources. We exploit the fact that all these tasks involve sub-word sequence-to-sequence transformation to propose a systematic solution for all of them using neural encoder-decoder technology. The specific challenge that we tackle in this paper is integrating the traditional know-how on separate tasks into the neural sequence-to-sequence framework to improve the state of the art. We address this challenge by enriching the general framework with mechanisms that allow processing the information on multiple levels of text organization (characters, morphemes, words, sentences) in combination with structural information (multilevel language model, part-of-speech) and heterogeneous sources (text, dictionaries). We show that our solution consistently improves on the current methods in all three steps. In addition, we analyze the performance of our system to show the specific contribution of the integrating components to the overall improvement. ---------------


üìÑ Task-Oriented Language Grounding for Language Input with Multiple Sub-Goals of Non-Linear Order
### 27 Oct 2019 | Task-Oriented Language Grounding for Language Input with Multiple Sub-Goals of Non-Linear Order ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Vladislav Kurenkov, Bulat Maksudov, Adil Khan

In this work, we analyze the performance of general deep reinforcement learning algorithms for a task-oriented language grounding problem, where language input contains multiple sub-goals and their order of execution is non-linear. We generate a simple instructional language for the GridWorld environment, that is built around three language elements (order connectors) defining the order of execution: one linear - "comma" and two non-linear - "but first", "but before". We apply one of the deep reinforcement learning baselines - Double DQN with frame stacking and ablate several extensions such as Prioritized Experience Replay and Gated-Attention architecture. Our results show that the introduction of non-linear order connectors improves the success rate on instructions with a higher number of sub-goals in 2-3 times, but it still does not exceed 20%. Also, we observe that the usage of Gated-Attention provides no competitive advantage against concatenation in this setting.

üìÑ Learning to Break the Loop: Analyzing and Mitigating Repetitions for Neural Text Generation
### 09 Oct 2022 | Learning to Break the Loop: Analyzing and Mitigating Repetitions for Neural Text Generation ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Jin Xu, Xiaojiang Liu, Jianhao Yan, Deng Cai, Huayang Li, Jian Li

While large-scale neural language models, such as GPT2 and BART, have achieved impressive results on various text generation tasks, they tend to get stuck in undesirable sentence-level loops with maximization-based decoding algorithms (\textit{e.g.}, greedy search). This phenomenon is counter-intuitive since there are few consecutive sentence-level repetitions in human corpora (e.g., 0.02% in Wikitext-103). To investigate the underlying reasons for generating consecutive sentence-level repetitions, we study the relationship between the probabilities of the repetitive tokens and their previous repetitions in the context. Through our quantitative experiments, we find that 1) Language models have a preference to repeat the previous sentence; 2) The sentence-level repetitions have a \textit{self-reinforcement effect}: the more times a sentence is repeated in the context, the higher the probability of continuing to generate that sentence; 3) The sentences with higher initial probabilities usually have a stronger self-reinforcement effect. Motivated by our findings, we propose a simple and effective training method \textbf{DITTO} (Pseu\underline{D}o-Repet\underline{IT}ion Penaliza\underline{T}i\underline{O}n), where the model learns to penalize probabilities of sentence-level repetitions from pseudo repetitive data. Although our method is motivated by mitigating repetitions, experiments show that DITTO not only mitigates the repetition issue without sacrificing perplexity, but also achieves better generation quality. Extensive experiments on open-ended text generation (Wikitext-103) and text summarization (CNN/DailyMail) demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our method. ---------------


üìÑ Effect of Text Processing Steps on Twitter Sentiment Classification using Word Embedding
### 25 Jul 2020 | Effect of Text Processing Steps on Twitter Sentiment Classification using Word Embedding ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Manar D. Samad, Nalin D. Khounviengxay, Megan A. Witherow

Processing of raw text is the crucial first step in text classification and sentiment analysis. However, text processing steps are often performed using off-the-shelf routines and pre-built word dictionaries without optimizing for domain, application, and context. This paper investigates the effect of seven text processing scenarios on a particular text domain (Twitter) and application (sentiment classification). Skip gram-based word embeddings are developed to include Twitter colloquial words, emojis, and hashtag keywords that are often removed for being unavailable in conventional literature corpora. Our experiments reveal negative effects on sentiment classification of two common text processing steps: 1) stop word removal and 2) averaging of word vectors to represent individual tweets. New effective steps for 1) including non-ASCII emoji characters, 2) measuring word importance from word embedding, 3) aggregating word vectors into a tweet embedding, and 4) developing linearly separable feature space have been proposed to optimize the sentiment classification pipeline. The best combination of text processing steps yields the highest average area under the curve (AUC) of 88.4 (+/-0.4) in classifying 14,640 tweets with three sentiment labels. Word selection from context-driven word embedding reveals that only the ten most important words in Tweets cumulatively yield over 98% of the maximum accuracy. Results demonstrate a means for data-driven selection of important words in tweet classification as opposed to using pre-built word dictionaries. The proposed tweet embedding is robust to and alleviates the need for several text processing steps. ---------------


üìÑ STAGE: Span Tagging and Greedy Inference Scheme for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction
### 09 Apr 2023 | STAGE: Span Tagging and Greedy Inference Scheme for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Shuo Liang, Wei Wei, Xian-Ling Mao, Yuanyuan Fu, Rui Fang, Dangyang Chen

Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) has become an emerging task in sentiment analysis research, aiming to extract triplets of the aspect term, its corresponding opinion term, and its associated sentiment polarity from a given sentence. Recently, many neural networks based models with different tagging schemes have been proposed, but almost all of them have their limitations: heavily relying on 1) prior assumption that each word is only associated with a single role (e.g., aspect term, or opinion term, etc. ) and 2) word-level interactions and treating each opinion/aspect as a set of independent words. Hence, they perform poorly on the complex ASTE task, such as a word associated with multiple roles or an aspect/opinion term with multiple words. Hence, we propose a novel approach, Span TAgging and Greedy infErence (STAGE), to extract sentiment triplets in span-level, where each span may consist of multiple words and play different roles simultaneously. To this end, this paper formulates the ASTE task as a multi-class span classification problem. Specifically, STAGE generates more accurate aspect sentiment triplet extractions via exploring span-level information and constraints, which consists of two components, namely, span tagging scheme and greedy inference strategy. The former tag all possible candidate spans based on a newly-defined tagging set. The latter retrieves the aspect/opinion term with the maximum length from the candidate sentiment snippet to output sentiment triplets. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective model based on the STAGE, which outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a large margin on four widely-used datasets. Moreover, our STAGE can be easily generalized to other pair/triplet extraction tasks, which also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheme STAGE. ---------------


üìÑ Sentiment Analysis of German Twitter
### 29 Nov 2019 | Sentiment Analysis of German Twitter ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Wladimir Sidorenko

This thesis explores the ways by how people express their opinions on German Twitter, examines current approaches to automatic mining of these feelings, and proposes novel methods, which outperform state-of-the-art techniques. For this purpose, I introduce a new corpus of German tweets that have been manually annotated with sentiments, their targets and holders, as well as polar terms and their contextual modifiers. Using these data, I explore four major areas of sentiment research: (i) generation of sentiment lexicons, (ii) fine-grained opinion mining, (iii) message-level polarity classification, and (iv) discourse-aware sentiment analysis. In the first task, I compare three popular groups of lexicon generation methods: dictionary-, corpus-, and word-embedding-based ones, finding that dictionary-based systems generally yield better lexicons than the last two groups. Apart from this, I propose a linear projection algorithm, whose results surpass many existing automatic lexicons. Afterwords, in the second task, I examine two common approaches to automatic prediction of sentiments, sources, and targets: conditional random fields and recurrent neural networks, obtaining higher scores with the former model and improving these results even further by redefining the structure of CRF graphs. When dealing with message-level polarity classification, I juxtapose three major sentiment paradigms: lexicon-, machine-learning-, and deep-learning-based systems, and try to unite the first and last of these groups by introducing a bidirectional neural network with lexicon-based attention. Finally, in order to make the new classifier aware of discourse structure, I let it separately analyze the elementary discourse units of each microblog and infer the overall polarity of a message from the scores of its EDUs with the help of two new approaches: latent-marginalized CRFs and Recursive Dirichlet Process. ---------------


üìÑ Semantic and Syntactic Enhanced Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction
### 07 Jun 2021 | Semantic and Syntactic Enhanced Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Zhexue Chen, Hong Huang, Bang Liu, Xuanhua Shi, Hai Jin

Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets from sentences, where each triplet includes an entity, its associated sentiment, and the opinion span explaining the reason for the sentiment. Most existing research addresses this problem in a multi-stage pipeline manner, which neglects the mutual information between such three elements and has the problem of error propagation. In this paper, we propose a Semantic and Syntactic Enhanced aspect Sentiment triplet Extraction model (S3E2) to fully exploit the syntactic and semantic relationships between the triplet elements and jointly extract them. Specifically, we design a Graph-Sequence duel representation and modeling paradigm for the task of ASTE: we represent the semantic and syntactic relationships between word pairs in a sentence by graph and encode it by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as well as modeling the original sentence by LSTM to preserve the sequential information. Under this setting, we further apply a more efficient inference strategy for the extraction of triplets. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets show that S3E2 significantly outperforms existing approaches, which proves our S3E2's superiority and flexibility in an end-to-end fashion. ---------------


üìÑ Outline Generation: Understanding the Inherent Content Structure of Documents
### 24 May 2019 | Outline Generation: Understanding the Inherent Content Structure of Documents ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Yixing Fan, Yanyan Lan, and Xueqi Cheng

In this paper, we introduce and tackle the Outline Generation (OG) task, which aims to unveil the inherent content structure of a multi-paragraph document by identifying its potential sections and generating the corresponding section headings. Without loss of generality, the OG task can be viewed as a novel structured summarization task. To generate a sound outline, an ideal OG model should be able to capture three levels of coherence, namely the coherence between context paragraphs, that between a section and its heading, and that between context headings. The first one is the foundation for section identification, while the latter two are critical for consistent heading generation. In this work, we formulate the OG task as a hierarchical structured prediction problem, i.e., to first predict a sequence of section boundaries and then a sequence of section headings accordingly. We propose a novel hierarchical structured neural generation model, named HiStGen, for the task. Our model attempts to capture the three-level coherence via the following ways. First, we introduce a Markov paragraph dependency mechanism between context paragraphs for section identification. Second, we employ a section-aware attention mechanism to ensure the semantic coherence between a section and its heading. Finally, we leverage a Markov heading dependency mechanism and a review mechanism between context headings to improve the consistency and eliminate duplication between section headings. Besides, we build a novel WIKIOG dataset, a public collection which consists of over 1.75 million document-outline pairs for research on the OG task. Experimental results on our benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art sequential generation models for the OG task. ---------------


üìÑ Beyond Narrative Description: Generating Poetry from Images by Multi-Adversarial Training
### 10 Oct 2018 | Beyond Narrative Description: Generating Poetry from Images by Multi-Adversarial Training ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Bei Liu, Jianlong Fu, Makoto P. Kato, Masatoshi Yoshikawa

Automatic generation of natural language from images has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, we take one step further to investigate generation of poetic language (with multiple lines) to an image for automatic poetry creation. This task involves multiple challenges, including discovering poetic clues from the image (e.g., hope from green), and generating poems to satisfy both relevance to the image and poeticness in language level. To solve the above challenges, we formulate the task of poem generation into two correlated sub-tasks by multi-adversarial training via policy gradient, through which the cross-modal relevance and poetic language style can be ensured. To extract poetic clues from images, we propose to learn a deep coupled visual-poetic embedding, in which the poetic representation from objects, sentiments and scenes in an image can be jointly learned. Two discriminative networks are further introduced to guide the poem generation, including a multi-modal discriminator and a poem-style discriminator. To facilitate the research, we have released two poem datasets by human annotators with two distinct properties: 1) the first human annotated image-to-poem pair dataset (with 8,292 pairs in total), and 2) to-date the largest public English poem corpus dataset (with 92,265 different poems in total). Extensive experiments are conducted with 8K images, among which 1.5K image are randomly picked for evaluation. Both objective and subjective evaluations show the superior performances against the state-of-the-art methods for poem generation from images. Turing test carried out with over 500 human subjects, among which 30 evaluators are poetry experts, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. ---------------


üìÑ A Systematic Study of Leveraging Subword Information for Learning Word Representations
### 04 May 2019 | A Systematic Study of Leveraging Subword Information for Learning Word Representations ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Yi Zhu, Ivan Vuli'c, Anna Korhonen

The use of subword-level information (e.g., characters, character n-grams, morphemes) has become ubiquitous in modern word representation learning. Its importance is attested especially for morphologically rich languages which generate a large number of rare words. Despite a steadily increasing interest in such subword-informed word representations, their systematic comparative analysis across typologically diverse languages and different tasks is still missing. In this work, we deliver such a study focusing on the variation of two crucial components required for subword-level integration into word representation models: 1) segmentation of words into subword units, and 2) subword composition functions to obtain final word representations. We propose a general framework for learning subword-informed word representations that allows for easy experimentation with different segmentation and composition components, also including more advanced techniques based on position embeddings and self-attention. Using the unified framework, we run experiments over a large number of subword-informed word representation configurations (60 in total) on 3 tasks (general and rare word similarity, dependency parsing, fine-grained entity typing) for 5 languages representing 3 language types. Our main results clearly indicate that there is no "one-sizefits-all" configuration, as performance is both language- and task-dependent. We also show that configurations based on unsupervised segmentation (e.g., BPE, Morfessor) are sometimes comparable to or even outperform the ones based on supervised word segmentation. ---------------


üìÑ Building a language evolution tree based on word vector combination model
### 04 Oct 2018 | Building a language evolution tree based on word vector combination model ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Zhu Gao, Yanhui Jiang, Junhui Gao

In this paper, we try to explore the evolution of language through case calculations. First, we chose the novels of eleven British writers from 1400 to 2005 and found the corresponding works; Then, we use the natural language processing tool to construct the corresponding eleven corpora, and calculate the respective word vectors of 100 high-frequency words in eleven corpora; Next, for each corpus, we concatenate the 100 word vectors from beginning to end into one; Finally, we use the similarity comparison and hierarchical clustering method to generate the relationship tree between the combined eleven word vectors. This tree represents the relationship between eleven corpora. We found that in the tree generated by clustering, the distance between the corpus and the year corresponding to the corpus are basically the same. This means that we have discovered a specific language evolution tree. To verify the stability and versatility of this method, we add three other themes: Dickens's eight works, the 19th century poets' works, and art criticism of recent 60 years. For these four themes, we tested different parameters such as the time span of the corpus, the time interval between the corpora, the dimension of the word vector, and the number of high-frequency public words. The results show that this is fairly stable and versatile. ---------------


üìÑ SelfSeg: A Self-supervised Sub-word Segmentation Method for Neural Machine Translation
### 31 Jul 2023 | SelfSeg: A Self-supervised Sub-word Segmentation Method for Neural Machine Translation ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Haiyue Song, Raj Dabre, Chenhui Chu, Sadao Kurohashi, and Eiichiro Sumita

Sub-word segmentation is an essential pre-processing step for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Existing work has shown that neural sub-word segmenters are better than Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), however, they are inefficient as they require parallel corpora, days to train and hours to decode. This paper introduces SelfSeg, a self-supervised neural sub-word segmentation method that is much faster to train/decode and requires only monolingual dictionaries instead of parallel corpora. SelfSeg takes as input a word in the form of a partially masked character sequence, optimizes the word generation probability and generates the segmentation with the maximum posterior probability, which is calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm. The training time of SelfSeg depends on word frequencies, and we explore several word frequency normalization strategies to accelerate the training phase. Additionally, we propose a regularization mechanism that allows the segmenter to generate various segmentations for one word. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct MT experiments in low-, middle- and high-resource scenarios, where we compare the performance of using different segmentation methods. The experimental results demonstrate that on the low-resource ALT dataset, our method achieves more than 1.2 BLEU score improvement compared with BPE and SentencePiece, and a 1.1 score improvement over Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE) and Vocabulary Learning via Optimal Transport (VOLT) on average. The regularization method achieves approximately a 4.3 BLEU score improvement over BPE and a 1.2 BLEU score improvement over BPE-dropout, the regularized version of BPE. We also observed significant improvements on IWSLT15 Vi->En, WMT16 Ro->En and WMT15 Fi->En datasets, and competitive results on the WMT14 De->En and WMT14 Fr->En datasets. ---------------


üìÑ UIUC_BioNLP at SemEval-2021 Task 11: A Cascade of Neural Models for Structuring Scholarly NLP Contributions
### 12 May 2021 | UIUC_BioNLP at SemEval-2021 Task 11: A Cascade of Neural Models for Structuring Scholarly NLP Contributions ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Haoyang Liu, M. Janina Sarol and Halil Kilicoglu

We propose a cascade of neural models that performs sentence classification, phrase recognition, and triple extraction to automatically structure the scholarly contributions of NLP publications. To identify the most important contribution sentences in a paper, we used a BERT-based classifier with positional features (Subtask 1). A BERT-CRF model was used to recognize and characterize relevant phrases in contribution sentences (Subtask 2). We categorized the triples into several types based on whether and how their elements were expressed in text, and addressed each type using separate BERT-based classifiers as well as rules (Subtask 3). Our system was officially ranked second in Phase 1 evaluation and first in both parts of Phase 2 evaluation. After fixing a submission error in Pharse 1, our approach yields the best results overall. In this paper, in addition to a system description, we also provide further analysis of our results, highlighting its strengths and limitations. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/nlp-contrib-graph. ---------------


üìÑ A Robust Parsing Algorithm For Link Grammars
### 02 Aug 1995 | A Robust Parsing Algorithm For Link Grammars ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Dennis Grinberg, John Lafferty, Daniel Sleator (Carnegie Mellon)

In this paper we present a robust parsing algorithm based on the link grammar formalism for parsing natural languages. Our algorithm is a natural extension of the original dynamic programming recognition algorithm which recursively counts the number of linkages between two words in the input sentence. The modified algorithm uses the notion of a null link in order to allow a connection between any pair of adjacent words, regardless of their dictionary definitions. The algorithm proceeds by making three dynamic programming passes. In the first pass, the input is parsed using the original algorithm which enforces the constraints on links to ensure grammaticality. In the second pass, the total cost of each substring of words is computed, where cost is determined by the number of null links necessary to parse the substring. The final pass counts the total number of parses with minimal cost. All of the original pruning techniques have natural counterparts in the robust algorithm. When used together with memoization, these techniques enable the algorithm to run efficiently with cubic worst-case complexity. We have implemented these ideas and tested them by parsing the Switchboard corpus of conversational English. This corpus is comprised of approximately three million words of text, corresponding to more than 150 hours of transcribed speech collected from telephone conversations restricted to 70 different topics. Although only a small fraction of the sentences in this corpus are "grammatical" by standard criteria, the robust link grammar parser is able to extract relevant structure for a large portion of the sentences. We present the results of our experiments using this system, including the analyses of selected and random sentences from the corpus. ---------------

### 09 Sep 2022 | Summarize, Outline, and Elaborate: Long-Text Generation via Hierarchical Supervision from Extractive Summaries ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Xiaofei Sun, Zijun Sun, Yuxian Meng, Jiwei Li and Chun Fan

The difficulty of generating coherent long texts lies in the fact that existing models overwhelmingly focus on predicting local words, and cannot make high level plans on what to generate or capture the high-level discourse dependencies between chunks of texts. Inspired by human writing processes, where a list of bullet points or a catalog is first outlined, and then each bullet point is expanded to form the whole article, we propose {\it SOE}, a pipelined system that involves of summarizing, outlining and elaborating for long text generation: the model first outlines the summaries for different segments of long texts, and then elaborates on each bullet point to generate the corresponding segment. To avoid the labor-intensive process of summary soliciting, we propose the {\it reconstruction} strategy, which extracts segment summaries in an unsupervised manner by selecting its most informative part to reconstruct the segment. The proposed generation system comes with the following merits: (1) the summary provides high-level guidance for text generation and avoids the local minimum of individual word predictions; (2) the high-level discourse dependencies are captured in the conditional dependencies between summaries and are preserved during the summary expansion process and (3) additionally, we are able to consider significantly more contexts by representing contexts as concise summaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOE produces long texts with significantly better quality, along with faster convergence speed. ---------------


üìÑ Semantically-Aligned Universal Tree-Structured Solver for Math Word Problems
### 14 Oct 2020 | Semantically-Aligned Universal Tree-Structured Solver for Math Word Problems ‚Äî Arxiv Link)

Authors: Jinghui Qin, Lihui Lin, Xiaodan Liang, Rumin Zhang, Liang Lin

A practical automatic textual math word problems (MWPs) solver should be able to solve various textual MWPs while most existing works only focused on one-unknown linear MWPs. Herein, we propose a simple but efficient method called Universal Expression Tree (UET) to make the first attempt to represent the equations of various MWPs uniformly. Then a semantically-aligned universal tree-structured solver (SAU-Solver) based on an encoder-decoder framework is proposed to resolve multiple types of MWPs in a unified model, benefiting from our UET representation. Our SAU-Solver generates a universal expression tree explicitly by deciding which symbol to generate according to the generated symbols' semantic meanings like human solving MWPs. Besides, our SAU-Solver also includes a novel subtree-level semanticallyaligned regularization to further enforce the semantic constraints and rationality of the generated expression tree by aligning with the contextual information. Finally, to validate the universality of our solver and extend the research boundary of MWPs, we introduce a new challenging Hybrid Math Word Problems dataset (HMWP), consisting of three types of MWPs. Experimental results on several MWPs datasets show that our model can solve universal types of MWPs and outperforms several state-of-the-art models

Create a fifteen second song singing about the arXiv research paper outline I have summarized into 4 word prose per line with appropriate emoji.  This is a template I would like to reuse.  What I want is a suboutline that is numbered 1,2,3 under the existing numbered lines and change each line for these suboutline numbered statements to be three words only.  Also make sure all three rhyme by adding a fourth rhyming word shared by each line to sing rhymes of them in triplets under the top line:     1. üß† Emergent Neural Pathway Discovery

remind them you know I have to remind them unfortunately complex operation so it's a highly complex operation the conditions out there are extremely well

I understand this is a highly complex and difficult operation given the extreme conditions. However, I don't have enough context to determine exactly what you need to remind them about. Could you please provide some more details so I can better assist in reminding or communicating the necessary information appropriately? Having clarity on the specifics will help ensure the reminder is properly conveyed.

...


it seems you need to remind someone about a highly complex operation being carried out under extremely challenging conditions. Here are a few suggestions on how to convey this professionally:

"I want to reiterate that this is a highly intricate operation we are undertaking, with extremely challenging circumstances to navigate. I know the team is well-prepared, but it's important we remain vigilant and follow protocols closely given the complexities involved."

"As we move forward, I must remind everyone that the conditions we are operating under are exceptionally demanding. This is a highly complex endeavor that will require our full focus and adherence to procedures. Please keep the difficulties in mind as we proceed."

"Let me reemphasize the complexity of this operation and the extreme conditions present. This is not a simple undertaking by any means. I have full confidence in our readiness, but want to ensure we maintain situational awareness given the challenges."

The key points are reinforcing it is a very complex, difficult operation, the conditions create additional challenges, and prompting the team to remain focused and follow established protocols carefully. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional context to provide.

üß† Emergent Neural Pathway Discovery

I don't actually have the capability to discover or map neural pathways. I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I don't have access to real neuroscientific data or the ability to analyze the physical structure of brains. I can have natural conversations and provide information to the best of my training, but discovering neural pathways is beyond my current artificial capabilities.
