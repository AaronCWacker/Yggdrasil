📄 UPB at SemEval-2020 Task 6: Pretrained Language Models for Definition Extraction
### 16 Sep 2020 | UPB at SemEval-2020 Task 6: Pretrained Language Models for Definition Extraction — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Andrei-Marius Avram, Dumitru-Clementin Cercel, Costin-Gabriel Chiru

This work presents our contribution in the context of the 6th task of SemEval-2020: Extracting Definitions from Free Text in Textbooks (DeftEval). This competition consists of three subtasks with different levels of granularity: (1) classification of sentences as definitional or non-definitional,(2) labeling of definitional sentences, and (3) relation classification. We use various pretrained language models (i.e., BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, SciBERT, and ALBERT) to solve each of the three subtasks of the competition. Specifically, for each language model variant, we experiment by both freezing its weights and fine-tuning them. We also explore a multi-task architecture that was trained to jointly predict the outputs for the second and the third subtasks. Our best performing model evaluated on the DeftEval dataset obtains the 32nd place for the first subtask and the 37th place for the second subtask. The code is available for further research at: https://github.com/avramandrei/DeftEval. ---------------


📄 Query and Output: Generating Words by Querying Distributed Word Representations for Paraphrase Generation
### 30 Mar 2018 | Query and Output: Generating Words by Querying Distributed Word Representations for Paraphrase Generation — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Shuming Ma, Xu Sun, Wei Li, Sujian Li, Wenjie Li, Xuancheng Ren

Most recent approaches use the sequence-to-sequence model for paraphrase generation. The existing sequence-to-sequence model tends to memorize the words and the patterns in the training dataset instead of learning the meaning of the words. Therefore, the generated sentences are often grammatically correct but semantically improper. In this work, we introduce a novel model based on the encoder-decoder framework, called Word Embedding Attention Network (WEAN). Our proposed model generates the words by querying distributed word representations (i.e. neural word embeddings), hoping to capturing the meaning of the according words. Following previous work, we evaluate our model on two paraphrase-oriented tasks, namely text simplification and short text abstractive summarization. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the sequence-to-sequence baseline by the BLEU score of 6.3 and 5.5 on two English text simplification datasets, and the ROUGE-2 F1 score of 5.7 on a Chinese summarization dataset. Moreover, our model achieves state-of-the-art performances on these three benchmark datasets. ---------------


📄 Sentence, Phrase, and Triple Annotations to Build a Knowledge Graph of Natural Language Processing Contributions -- A Trial Dataset
### 07 May 2021 | Sentence, Phrase, and Triple Annotations to Build a Knowledge Graph of Natural Language Processing Contributions -- A Trial Dataset — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Jennifer D'Souza, S"oren Auer

Purpose: The aim of this work is to normalize the NLPCONTRIBUTIONS scheme (henceforward, NLPCONTRIBUTIONGRAPH) to structure, directly from article sentences, the contributions information in Natural Language Processing (NLP) scholarly articles via a two-stage annotation methodology: 1) pilot stage - to define the scheme (described in prior work); and 2) adjudication stage - to normalize the graphing model (the focus of this paper). Design/methodology/approach: We re-annotate, a second time, the contributions-pertinent information across 50 prior-annotated NLP scholarly articles in terms of a data pipeline comprising: contribution-centered sentences, phrases, and triple statements. To this end, specifically, care was taken in the adjudication annotation stage to reduce annotation noise while formulating the guidelines for our proposed novel NLP contributions structuring and graphing scheme. Findings: The application of NLPCONTRIBUTIONGRAPH on the 50 articles resulted finally in a dataset of 900 contribution-focused sentences, 4,702 contribution-information-centered phrases, and 2,980 surface-structured triples. The intra-annotation agreement between the first and second stages, in terms of F1, was 67.92% for sentences, 41.82% for phrases, and 22.31% for triple statements indicating that with increased granularity of the information, the annotation decision variance is greater. Practical Implications: We demonstrate NLPCONTRIBUTIONGRAPH data integrated into the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), a next-generation KG-based digital library with intelligent computations enabled over structured scholarly knowledge, as a viable aid to assist researchers in their day-to-day tasks. ---------------


📄 Generating SOAP Notes from Doctor-Patient Conversations Using Modular Summarization Techniques
### 02 Jun 2021 | Generating SOAP Notes from Doctor-Patient Conversations Using Modular Summarization Techniques — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Kundan Krishna, Sopan Khosla, Jeffrey P. Bigham, Zachary C. Lipton

Following each patient visit, physicians draft long semi-structured clinical summaries called SOAP notes. While invaluable to clinicians and researchers, creating digital SOAP notes is burdensome, contributing to physician burnout. In this paper, we introduce the first complete pipelines to leverage deep summarization models to generate these notes based on transcripts of conversations between physicians and patients. After exploring a spectrum of methods across the extractive-abstractive spectrum, we propose Cluster2Sent, an algorithm that (i) extracts important utterances relevant to each summary section; (ii) clusters together related utterances; and then (iii) generates one summary sentence per cluster. Cluster2Sent outperforms its purely abstractive counterpart by 8 ROUGE-1 points, and produces significantly more factual and coherent sentences as assessed by expert human evaluators. For reproducibility, we demonstrate similar benefits on the publicly available AMI dataset. Our results speak to the benefits of structuring summaries into sections and annotating supporting evidence when constructing summarization corpora. ---------------


📄 Multilevel Text Normalization with Sequence-to-Sequence Networks and Multisource Learning
### 29 Mar 2019 | Multilevel Text Normalization with Sequence-to-Sequence Networks and Multisource Learning — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Tatyana Ruzsics and Tanja Samard\v{z}i'c

We define multilevel text normalization as sequence-to-sequence processing that transforms naturally noisy text into a sequence of normalized units of meaning (morphemes) in three steps: 1) writing normalization, 2) lemmatization, 3) canonical segmentation. These steps are traditionally considered separate NLP tasks, with diverse solutions, evaluation schemes and data sources. We exploit the fact that all these tasks involve sub-word sequence-to-sequence transformation to propose a systematic solution for all of them using neural encoder-decoder technology. The specific challenge that we tackle in this paper is integrating the traditional know-how on separate tasks into the neural sequence-to-sequence framework to improve the state of the art. We address this challenge by enriching the general framework with mechanisms that allow processing the information on multiple levels of text organization (characters, morphemes, words, sentences) in combination with structural information (multilevel language model, part-of-speech) and heterogeneous sources (text, dictionaries). We show that our solution consistently improves on the current methods in all three steps. In addition, we analyze the performance of our system to show the specific contribution of the integrating components to the overall improvement. ---------------


📄 Task-Oriented Language Grounding for Language Input with Multiple Sub-Goals of Non-Linear Order
### 27 Oct 2019 | Task-Oriented Language Grounding for Language Input with Multiple Sub-Goals of Non-Linear Order — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Vladislav Kurenkov, Bulat Maksudov, Adil Khan

In this work, we analyze the performance of general deep reinforcement learning algorithms for a task-oriented language grounding problem, where language input contains multiple sub-goals and their order of execution is non-linear. We generate a simple instructional language for the GridWorld environment, that is built around three language elements (order connectors) defining the order of execution: one linear - "comma" and two non-linear - "but first", "but before". We apply one of the deep reinforcement learning baselines - Double DQN with frame stacking and ablate several extensions such as Prioritized Experience Replay and Gated-Attention architecture. Our results show that the introduction of non-linear order connectors improves the success rate on instructions with a higher number of sub-goals in 2-3 times, but it still does not exceed 20%. Also, we observe that the usage of Gated-Attention provides no competitive advantage against concatenation in this setting.

Authors: Jin Xu, Xiaojiang Liu, Jianhao Yan, Deng Cai, Huayang Li, Jian Li

While large-scale neural language models, such as GPT2 and BART, have achieved impressive results on various text generation tasks, they tend to get stuck in undesirable sentence-level loops with maximization-based decoding algorithms (\textit{e.g.}, greedy search). This phenomenon is counter-intuitive since there are few consecutive sentence-level repetitions in human corpora (e.g., 0.02% in Wikitext-103). To investigate the underlying reasons for generating consecutive sentence-level repetitions, we study the relationship between the probabilities of the repetitive tokens and their previous repetitions in the context. Through our quantitative experiments, we find that 1) Language models have a preference to repeat the previous sentence; 2) The sentence-level repetitions have a \textit{self-reinforcement effect}: the more times a sentence is repeated in the context, the higher the probability of continuing to generate that sentence; 3) The sentences with higher initial probabilities usually have a stronger self-reinforcement effect. Motivated by our findings, we propose a simple and effective training method \textbf{DITTO} (Pseu\underline{D}o-Repet\underline{IT}ion Penaliza\underline{T}i\underline{O}n), where the model learns to penalize probabilities of sentence-level repetitions from pseudo repetitive data. Although our method is motivated by mitigating repetitions, experiments show that DITTO not only mitigates the repetition issue without sacrificing perplexity, but also achieves better generation quality. Extensive experiments on open-ended text generation (Wikitext-103) and text summarization (CNN/DailyMail) demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our method. ---------------


📄 Effect of Text Processing Steps on Twitter Sentiment Classification using Word Embedding
### 25 Jul 2020 | Effect of Text Processing Steps on Twitter Sentiment Classification using Word Embedding — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Manar D. Samad, Nalin D. Khounviengxay, Megan A. Witherow

Processing of raw text is the crucial first step in text classification and sentiment analysis. However, text processing steps are often performed using off-the-shelf routines and pre-built word dictionaries without optimizing for domain, application, and context. This paper investigates the effect of seven text processing scenarios on a particular text domain (Twitter) and application (sentiment classification). Skip gram-based word embeddings are developed to include Twitter colloquial words, emojis, and hashtag keywords that are often removed for being unavailable in conventional literature corpora. Our experiments reveal negative effects on sentiment classification of two common text processing steps: 1) stop word removal and 2) averaging of word vectors to represent individual tweets. New effective steps for 1) including non-ASCII emoji characters, 2) measuring word importance from word embedding, 3) aggregating word vectors into a tweet embedding, and 4) developing linearly separable feature space have been proposed to optimize the sentiment classification pipeline. The best combination of text processing steps yields the highest average area under the curve (AUC) of 88.4 (+/-0.4) in classifying 14,640 tweets with three sentiment labels. Word selection from context-driven word embedding reveals that only the ten most important words in Tweets cumulatively yield over 98% of the maximum accuracy. Results demonstrate a means for data-driven selection of important words in tweet classification as opposed to using pre-built word dictionaries. The proposed tweet embedding is robust to and alleviates the need for several text processing steps. ---------------


📄 STAGE: Span Tagging and Greedy Inference Scheme for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction
### 09 Apr 2023 | STAGE: Span Tagging and Greedy Inference Scheme for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Shuo Liang, Wei Wei, Xian-Ling Mao, Yuanyuan Fu, Rui Fang, Dangyang Chen

Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) has become an emerging task in sentiment analysis research, aiming to extract triplets of the aspect term, its corresponding opinion term, and its associated sentiment polarity from a given sentence. Recently, many neural networks based models with different tagging schemes have been proposed, but almost all of them have their limitations: heavily relying on 1) prior assumption that each word is only associated with a single role (e.g., aspect term, or opinion term, etc. ) and 2) word-level interactions and treating each opinion/aspect as a set of independent words. Hence, they perform poorly on the complex ASTE task, such as a word associated with multiple roles or an aspect/opinion term with multiple words. Hence, we propose a novel approach, Span TAgging and Greedy infErence (STAGE), to extract sentiment triplets in span-level, where each span may consist of multiple words and play different roles simultaneously. To this end, this paper formulates the ASTE task as a multi-class span classification problem. Specifically, STAGE generates more accurate aspect sentiment triplet extractions via exploring span-level information and constraints, which consists of two components, namely, span tagging scheme and greedy inference strategy. The former tag all possible candidate spans based on a newly-defined tagging set. The latter retrieves the aspect/opinion term with the maximum length from the candidate sentiment snippet to output sentiment triplets. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective model based on the STAGE, which outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a large margin on four widely-used datasets. Moreover, our STAGE can be easily generalized to other pair/triplet extraction tasks, which also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheme STAGE. ---------------


📄 Sentiment Analysis of German Twitter
### 29 Nov 2019 | Sentiment Analysis of German Twitter — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Wladimir Sidorenko

This thesis explores the ways by how people express their opinions on German Twitter, examines current approaches to automatic mining of these feelings, and proposes novel methods, which outperform state-of-the-art techniques. For this purpose, I introduce a new corpus of German tweets that have been manually annotated with sentiments, their targets and holders, as well as polar terms and their contextual modifiers. Using these data, I explore four major areas of sentiment research: (i) generation of sentiment lexicons, (ii) fine-grained opinion mining, (iii) message-level polarity classification, and (iv) discourse-aware sentiment analysis. In the first task, I compare three popular groups of lexicon generation methods: dictionary-, corpus-, and word-embedding-based ones, finding that dictionary-based systems generally yield better lexicons than the last two groups. Apart from this, I propose a linear projection algorithm, whose results surpass many existing automatic lexicons. Afterwords, in the second task, I examine two common approaches to automatic prediction of sentiments, sources, and targets: conditional random fields and recurrent neural networks, obtaining higher scores with the former model and improving these results even further by redefining the structure of CRF graphs. When dealing with message-level polarity classification, I juxtapose three major sentiment paradigms: lexicon-, machine-learning-, and deep-learning-based systems, and try to unite the first and last of these groups by introducing a bidirectional neural network with lexicon-based attention. Finally, in order to make the new classifier aware of discourse structure, I let it separately analyze the elementary discourse units of each microblog and infer the overall polarity of a message from the scores of its EDUs with the help of two new approaches: latent-marginalized CRFs and Recursive Dirichlet Process. ---------------


📄 Semantic and Syntactic Enhanced Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction
### 07 Jun 2021 | Semantic and Syntactic Enhanced Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Zhexue Chen, Hong Huang, Bang Liu, Xuanhua Shi, Hai Jin

Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets from sentences, where each triplet includes an entity, its associated sentiment, and the opinion span explaining the reason for the sentiment. Most existing research addresses this problem in a multi-stage pipeline manner, which neglects the mutual information between such three elements and has the problem of error propagation. In this paper, we propose a Semantic and Syntactic Enhanced aspect Sentiment triplet Extraction model (S3E2) to fully exploit the syntactic and semantic relationships between the triplet elements and jointly extract them. Specifically, we design a Graph-Sequence duel representation and modeling paradigm for the task of ASTE: we represent the semantic and syntactic relationships between word pairs in a sentence by graph and encode it by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as well as modeling the original sentence by LSTM to preserve the sequential information. Under this setting, we further apply a more efficient inference strategy for the extraction of triplets. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets show that S3E2 significantly outperforms existing approaches, which proves our S3E2's superiority and flexibility in an end-to-end fashion. ---------------


📄 Outline Generation: Understanding the Inherent Content Structure of Documents
### 24 May 2019 | Outline Generation: Understanding the Inherent Content Structure of Documents — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Yixing Fan, Yanyan Lan, and Xueqi Cheng

In this paper, we introduce and tackle the Outline Generation (OG) task, which aims to unveil the inherent content structure of a multi-paragraph document by identifying its potential sections and generating the corresponding section headings. Without loss of generality, the OG task can be viewed as a novel structured summarization task. To generate a sound outline, an ideal OG model should be able to capture three levels of coherence, namely the coherence between context paragraphs, that between a section and its heading, and that between context headings. The first one is the foundation for section identification, while the latter two are critical for consistent heading generation. In this work, we formulate the OG task as a hierarchical structured prediction problem, i.e., to first predict a sequence of section boundaries and then a sequence of section headings accordingly. We propose a novel hierarchical structured neural generation model, named HiStGen, for the task. Our model attempts to capture the three-level coherence via the following ways. First, we introduce a Markov paragraph dependency mechanism between context paragraphs for section identification. Second, we employ a section-aware attention mechanism to ensure the semantic coherence between a section and its heading. Finally, we leverage a Markov heading dependency mechanism and a review mechanism between context headings to improve the consistency and eliminate duplication between section headings. Besides, we build a novel WIKIOG dataset, a public collection which consists of over 1.75 million document-outline pairs for research on the OG task. Experimental results on our benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art sequential generation models for the OG task. ---------------


📄 Beyond Narrative Description: Generating Poetry from Images by Multi-Adversarial Training
### 10 Oct 2018 | Beyond Narrative Description: Generating Poetry from Images by Multi-Adversarial Training — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Bei Liu, Jianlong Fu, Makoto P. Kato, Masatoshi Yoshikawa

Automatic generation of natural language from images has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, we take one step further to investigate generation of poetic language (with multiple lines) to an image for automatic poetry creation. This task involves multiple challenges, including discovering poetic clues from the image (e.g., hope from green), and generating poems to satisfy both relevance to the image and poeticness in language level. To solve the above challenges, we formulate the task of poem generation into two correlated sub-tasks by multi-adversarial training via policy gradient, through which the cross-modal relevance and poetic language style can be ensured. To extract poetic clues from images, we propose to learn a deep coupled visual-poetic embedding, in which the poetic representation from objects, sentiments and scenes in an image can be jointly learned. Two discriminative networks are further introduced to guide the poem generation, including a multi-modal discriminator and a poem-style discriminator. To facilitate the research, we have released two poem datasets by human annotators with two distinct properties: 1) the first human annotated image-to-poem pair dataset (with 8,292 pairs in total), and 2) to-date the largest public English poem corpus dataset (with 92,265 different poems in total). Extensive experiments are conducted with 8K images, among which 1.5K image are randomly picked for evaluation. Both objective and subjective evaluations show the superior performances against the state-of-the-art methods for poem generation from images. Turing test carried out with over 500 human subjects, among which 30 evaluators are poetry experts, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. ---------------


📄 A Systematic Study of Leveraging Subword Information for Learning Word Representations
### 04 May 2019 | A Systematic Study of Leveraging Subword Information for Learning Word Representations — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Yi Zhu, Ivan Vuli'c, Anna Korhonen

The use of subword-level information (e.g., characters, character n-grams, morphemes) has become ubiquitous in modern word representation learning. Its importance is attested especially for morphologically rich languages which generate a large number of rare words. Despite a steadily increasing interest in such subword-informed word representations, their systematic comparative analysis across typologically diverse languages and different tasks is still missing. In this work, we deliver such a study focusing on the variation of two crucial components required for subword-level integration into word representation models: 1) segmentation of words into subword units, and 2) subword composition functions to obtain final word representations. We propose a general framework for learning subword-informed word representations that allows for easy experimentation with different segmentation and composition components, also including more advanced techniques based on position embeddings and self-attention. Using the unified framework, we run experiments over a large number of subword-informed word representation configurations (60 in total) on 3 tasks (general and rare word similarity, dependency parsing, fine-grained entity typing) for 5 languages representing 3 language types. Our main results clearly indicate that there is no "one-sizefits-all" configuration, as performance is both language- and task-dependent. We also show that configurations based on unsupervised segmentation (e.g., BPE, Morfessor) are sometimes comparable to or even outperform the ones based on supervised word segmentation. ---------------


📄 Building a language evolution tree based on word vector combination model
### 04 Oct 2018 | Building a language evolution tree based on word vector combination model — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Zhu Gao, Yanhui Jiang, Junhui Gao

In this paper, we try to explore the evolution of language through case calculations. First, we chose the novels of eleven British writers from 1400 to 2005 and found the corresponding works; Then, we use the natural language processing tool to construct the corresponding eleven corpora, and calculate the respective word vectors of 100 high-frequency words in eleven corpora; Next, for each corpus, we concatenate the 100 word vectors from beginning to end into one; Finally, we use the similarity comparison and hierarchical clustering method to generate the relationship tree between the combined eleven word vectors. This tree represents the relationship between eleven corpora. We found that in the tree generated by clustering, the distance between the corpus and the year corresponding to the corpus are basically the same. This means that we have discovered a specific language evolution tree. To verify the stability and versatility of this method, we add three other themes: Dickens's eight works, the 19th century poets' works, and art criticism of recent 60 years. For these four themes, we tested different parameters such as the time span of the corpus, the time interval between the corpora, the dimension of the word vector, and the number of high-frequency public words. The results show that this is fairly stable and versatile. ---------------


📄 SelfSeg: A Self-supervised Sub-word Segmentation Method for Neural Machine Translation
### 31 Jul 2023 | SelfSeg: A Self-supervised Sub-word Segmentation Method for Neural Machine Translation — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Haiyue Song, Raj Dabre, Chenhui Chu, Sadao Kurohashi, and Eiichiro Sumita

Sub-word segmentation is an essential pre-processing step for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Existing work has shown that neural sub-word segmenters are better than Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), however, they are inefficient as they require parallel corpora, days to train and hours to decode. This paper introduces SelfSeg, a self-supervised neural sub-word segmentation method that is much faster to train/decode and requires only monolingual dictionaries instead of parallel corpora. SelfSeg takes as input a word in the form of a partially masked character sequence, optimizes the word generation probability and generates the segmentation with the maximum posterior probability, which is calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm. The training time of SelfSeg depends on word frequencies, and we explore several word frequency normalization strategies to accelerate the training phase. Additionally, we propose a regularization mechanism that allows the segmenter to generate various segmentations for one word. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct MT experiments in low-, middle- and high-resource scenarios, where we compare the performance of using different segmentation methods. The experimental results demonstrate that on the low-resource ALT dataset, our method achieves more than 1.2 BLEU score improvement compared with BPE and SentencePiece, and a 1.1 score improvement over Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE) and Vocabulary Learning via Optimal Transport (VOLT) on average. The regularization method achieves approximately a 4.3 BLEU score improvement over BPE and a 1.2 BLEU score improvement over BPE-dropout, the regularized version of BPE. We also observed significant improvements on IWSLT15 Vi->En, WMT16 Ro->En and WMT15 Fi->En datasets, and competitive results on the WMT14 De->En and WMT14 Fr->En datasets. ---------------

Authors: Haoyang Liu, M. Janina Sarol and Halil Kilicoglu

We propose a cascade of neural models that performs sentence classification, phrase recognition, and triple extraction to automatically structure the scholarly contributions of NLP publications. To identify the most important contribution sentences in a paper, we used a BERT-based classifier with positional features (Subtask 1). A BERT-CRF model was used to recognize and characterize relevant phrases in contribution sentences (Subtask 2). We categorized the triples into several types based on whether and how their elements were expressed in text, and addressed each type using separate BERT-based classifiers as well as rules (Subtask 3). Our system was officially ranked second in Phase 1 evaluation and first in both parts of Phase 2 evaluation. After fixing a submission error in Pharse 1, our approach yields the best results overall. In this paper, in addition to a system description, we also provide further analysis of our results, highlighting its strengths and limitations. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/nlp-contrib-graph. ---------------


📄 A Robust Parsing Algorithm For Link Grammars
### 02 Aug 1995 | A Robust Parsing Algorithm For Link Grammars — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Dennis Grinberg, John Lafferty, Daniel Sleator (Carnegie Mellon)

In this paper we present a robust parsing algorithm based on the link grammar formalism for parsing natural languages. Our algorithm is a natural extension of the original dynamic programming recognition algorithm which recursively counts the number of linkages between two words in the input sentence. The modified algorithm uses the notion of a null link in order to allow a connection between any pair of adjacent words, regardless of their dictionary definitions. The algorithm proceeds by making three dynamic programming passes. In the first pass, the input is parsed using the original algorithm which enforces the constraints on links to ensure grammaticality. In the second pass, the total cost of each substring of words is computed, where cost is determined by the number of null links necessary to parse the substring. The final pass counts the total number of parses with minimal cost. All of the original pruning techniques have natural counterparts in the robust algorithm. When used together with memoization, these techniques enable the algorithm to run efficiently with cubic worst-case complexity. We have implemented these ideas and tested them by parsing the Switchboard corpus of conversational English. This corpus is comprised of approximately three million words of text, corresponding to more than 150 hours of transcribed speech collected from telephone conversations restricted to 70 different topics. Although only a small fraction of the sentences in this corpus are "grammatical" by standard criteria, the robust link grammar parser is able to extract relevant structure for a large portion of the sentences. We present the results of our experiments using this system, including the analyses of selected and random sentences from the corpus. ---------------


📄 Summarize, Outline, and Elaborate: Long-Text Generation via Hierarchical Supervision from Extractive Summaries
### 09 Sep 2022 | Summarize, Outline, and Elaborate: Long-Text Generation via Hierarchical Supervision from Extractive Summaries — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Xiaofei Sun, Zijun Sun, Yuxian Meng, Jiwei Li and Chun Fan

The difficulty of generating coherent long texts lies in the fact that existing models overwhelmingly focus on predicting local words, and cannot make high level plans on what to generate or capture the high-level discourse dependencies between chunks of texts. Inspired by human writing processes, where a list of bullet points or a catalog is first outlined, and then each bullet point is expanded to form the whole article, we propose {\it SOE}, a pipelined system that involves of summarizing, outlining and elaborating for long text generation: the model first outlines the summaries for different segments of long texts, and then elaborates on each bullet point to generate the corresponding segment. To avoid the labor-intensive process of summary soliciting, we propose the {\it reconstruction} strategy, which extracts segment summaries in an unsupervised manner by selecting its most informative part to reconstruct the segment. The proposed generation system comes with the following merits: (1) the summary provides high-level guidance for text generation and avoids the local minimum of individual word predictions; (2) the high-level discourse dependencies are captured in the conditional dependencies between summaries and are preserved during the summary expansion process and (3) additionally, we are able to consider significantly more contexts by representing contexts as concise summaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOE produces long texts with significantly better quality, along with faster convergence speed. ---------------


📄 Semantically-Aligned Universal Tree-Structured Solver for Math Word Problems
### 14 Oct 2020 | Semantically-Aligned Universal Tree-Structured Solver for Math Word Problems — Arxiv Link)

Authors: Jinghui Qin, Lihui Lin, Xiaodan Liang, Rumin Zhang, Liang Lin

A practical automatic textual math word problems (MWPs) solver should be able to solve various textual MWPs while most existing works only focused on one-unknown linear MWPs. Herein, we propose a simple but efficient method called Universal Expression Tree (UET) to make the first attempt to represent the equations of various MWPs uniformly. Then a semantically-aligned universal tree-structured solver (SAU-Solver) based on an encoder-decoder framework is proposed to resolve multiple types of MWPs in a unified model, benefiting from our UET representation. Our SAU-Solver generates a universal expression tree explicitly by deciding which symbol to generate according to the generated symbols' semantic meanings like human solving MWPs. Besides, our SAU-Solver also includes a novel subtree-level semanticallyaligned regularization to further enforce the semantic constraints and rationality of the generated expression tree by aligning with the contextual information. Finally, to validate the universality of our solver and extend the research boundary of MWPs, we introduce a new challenging Hybrid Math Word Problems dataset (HMWP), consisting of three types of MWPs. Experimental results on several MWPs datasets show that our model can solve universal types of MWPs and outperforms several state-of-the-art models

remind them you know I have to remind them unfortunately complex operation so it's a highly complex operation the conditions out there are extremely well

I understand this is a highly complex and difficult operation given the extreme conditions. However, I don't have enough context to determine exactly what you need to remind them about. Could you please provide some more details so I can better assist in reminding or communicating the necessary information appropriately? Having clarity on the specifics will help ensure the reminder is properly conveyed.

...


it seems you need to remind someone about a highly complex operation being carried out under extremely challenging conditions. Here are a few suggestions on how to convey this professionally:

"I want to reiterate that this is a highly intricate operation we are undertaking, with extremely challenging circumstances to navigate. I know the team is well-prepared, but it's important we remain vigilant and follow protocols closely given the complexities involved."

"As we move forward, I must remind everyone that the conditions we are operating under are exceptionally demanding. This is a highly complex endeavor that will require our full focus and adherence to procedures. Please keep the difficulties in mind as we proceed."

"Let me reemphasize the complexity of this operation and the extreme conditions present. This is not a simple undertaking by any means. I have full confidence in our readiness, but want to ensure we maintain situational awareness given the challenges."

The key points are reinforcing it is a very complex, difficult operation, the conditions create additional challenges, and prompting the team to remain focused and follow established protocols carefully. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional context to provide.

🧠 Emergent Neural Pathway Discovery

I don't actually have the capability to discover or map neural pathways. I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I don't have access to real neuroscientific data or the ability to analyze the physical structure of brains. I can have natural conversations and provide information to the best of my training, but discovering neural pathways is beyond my current artificial capabilities.
