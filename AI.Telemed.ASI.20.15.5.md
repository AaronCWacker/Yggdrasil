Within AI and Telemed, I would like to present 20 papers, visually, and like lyrics of a five minute song with prose and video.

In this short tale we will show 20 AI/ML techniques just discovered within the last 5 years that lead to Artificial Super Intelligence in our time.

Being that we are living our lives striving to help others and learn as much as we can about things that matter to us I would like to say...

May you find giving and teaching at the core of sharing you building relationships and super intelligent organizations.

With this knowledge please pass it on.  May you live long and prosper.  


For the paper summaries below, create a short markdown outline tree with 3 levels of branches.  I plan to have exactly 4 words per branch.

Example below

1.2.3.4.5
