JR1993447
NVIDIA's continued advancement of world-leading hardware requires a combination of both external and internal EDA tools. Our team develops highly optimized internal tools by fusing advances in parallel computing, machine learning, and novel algorithms in C++. We are seeking an innovative CAD Software Architect and Developer with particular interest in Static Timing Analysis (STA) algorithms primarily at transistor-level. This position broadly spans circuit topology recognition, device and interconnect models, variation analysis, constraint application, and reporting. The driving goal is higher accuracy modeling of variation, crosstalk, dynamic IR drop, simultaneous switching, aging effects, and similar complexities based on continuous silicon feedback.

Constant creativity and a self-drive to explore and perfect fast, high-capacity software is required. If you like to work across many technical areas and see your successes directly realized in the world's best AI hardware, this is it! Developing software within a leading hardware company means getting to almost exclusively focus on the latest processes and most advanced designs. We also benefit from greater access to design parameters and manufacturing monitors to fine tune our models beyond the limits of external solutions. We're not bogged down by legacy support, niche roles, or convoluted approval processes. Our developers enjoy unusually high intellectual freedom and the ability to explore broad roles.
 

What you’ll be doing:

Extending internal STA (static timing analysis) tools, which are currently mostly gate-based, to directly analyze transistors, starting with traversal and recalculation engines.

Architecting new types of timing tools that efficiently combine static and dynamic methods.

Working with silicon correlation teams to understand weak points in our STA methodology and devising algorithms to improve Fmax (maximum frequency), Vmin (minimum voltage), and yield.

Improving integration across tools, such as more detailed SPICE deck generation.

As with any software engineering team, we do write a lot of code, but this is broader than a typical CAD or EDA role. Instead, we as a team own the whole process from discovery and invention of new opportunities, to developing solutions and working directly inside design teams to facilitate deployment.

What we need to see:

MS, PhD, or equivalent in Electrical Engineering (or equivalent experience)

8+ years experience including a mix of VLSI design and software development with significant experience in C++

Strong understanding of VLSI timing analysis concepts, including BSIM models, interconnect models, statistical models for variation, aging and reliability, characterization, timing constraints, corners, etc.

Good knowledge of STA algorithms including clustering, partitioning, graph traversal, moment-based analysis, and memory-efficient recalculation.

Familiarity with usage of existing timing analysis tools such as PrimeTime, NanoTime, Tempus, and FineSim/Spice.

Ways to stand out from the crowd:

C++14 or newer experience, such as lambdas and concurrency

Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling

Expertise in yield enhancement strategies and DFM (design for manufacturing)

Familiarity with SAT (boolean satisfiability) algorithms

Experience in high performance software design including multithreading, distributed computing, efficient memory and I/O use, etc.

Strong communication and interpersonal skills

NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology world’s most desirable employers, and due to outstanding growth, our teams are rapidly growing. Are you passionate about becoming a part of a best-in-class team driving the latest in GPU and AI technology? If so, we want to hear from you!

NVIDIA is a world-leader in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and accelerated computing. Our technology is a driving force in the advancement of visual AI from data centers to cars, robots, smart buildings, medical devices, and more. As models grow in capability, data scale, and generality, developers are faced with complex and expensive challenges from preparing hundreds of petabytes of data to validation of open world behaviors. Our team is building the accelerate software ecosystem to help developers through these barriers and to enable the next wave of advances in computer vision, multi-modal models, and GenAI.

We are now looking for an innovative technical leader to drive the capability of developer facing products for visual search, curation, 3d reconstruction, and more. The right candidate will combine curiosity for ground breaking research, creativity to identify developer focused applications of a range of computer vision and GenAI techniques, strong rapid prototyping skills, desire to teach and share technical vision, and a strong production sensibility. Looking to make computer vision ubiquitous, save the world billions of dollars and drive data center efficiency? This could be a phenomenal opportunity!

What you'll be doing:

Contributing to our technical strategy for visual AI developer software through insight into key developer challenges and innovative ways to mitigate those challenges with accelerated computing.

Invent and prototype new features, tools, workflows, and services that help AI developers advance the state of the art faster and more cost-effectively.

Drive new capabilities to production services that will run on hundreds or thousands of GPUs including profiling and optimizing code, building tests, deploying microservices, debugging quality gaps, fine tuning and optimize models, automating workflows, creating metrics and trackers.

Lead major projects including feature and architectural definition, project planning and estimation, execution, and mentorship for teammates.

Collaborate with our research teams to adapt their work and to influence research direction

Provide technical expertise in deep-learning based computer vision to teams across NVIDIA and support critical initiatives in this area

Demonstrate consistently high levels of creativity resulting in patents, product differentiation and advances in visual AI.

What we need to see:

MS or equivalent experience in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or related field.

Outstanding technical breadth across areas such as generative AI, visual understanding, and 3d reconstruction

Proficiency with Python and C++. Basic familiarity with GPU programming, e.g. in CUDA.

10+ year track record of converting research ideas into production software, leading development activities including algorithm selection, implementation, data collection, and validation.

Innovation resulting in outstanding products, patents, and publications.

Ways to Stand Out from the Crowd:

Proficiency with common cloud software such as Helm Charts, Milvus, ELK, Docker, etc.

Strong software architecture skills

Experience building developer centric tools and services
