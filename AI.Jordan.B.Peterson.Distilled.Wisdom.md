I'll help reformat this text into clear, complete sentences, removing timestamps and organizing the key points. I'll preserve the core ideas while making them more readable.

1. Write down everything you think a harmful habit might be doing to you, and don't worry about whether you're right or not - just make an exhaustive list.

2. After making your list, think through whether each effect is what you actually want, and write down what you want instead.

3. Any hedonistic endeavor is rewarding in the moment, but the real problem is the price you pay for it in the medium to long run.

4. To quit something that's gratifying in the short term, you need to know why you're quitting, otherwise you won't have the willpower to resist.

5. People often say "what the hell" to themselves when rationalizing harmful behaviors, and it's important to notice these self-rationalizations.

6. Ask yourself if your behaviors align with the sort of person you want to be and if they represent a model you'd want for your son.

7. Consider whether you're acting in a pattern that you would find admirable in others.

8. Pornography and masturbation don't fit into the ideal of heroic masculinity, as there's something furtive and second-rate about these behaviors.

9. These problematic behaviors tend to creep into society gradually, then rampage until young people can't remember a time without them.

10. The situation is likely to worsen with the development of AI-equipped adjustable pornographic content.

11. Currently, alienated young men can have better conversations with chatbots than with real people they've known.

12. Future AI services will offer fully developed two-dimensional simulations of women, which aren't real women but simulacra.

13. While these AI companions might give you everything you want, they're actually giving the worst part of you everything it wants.

14. One of the challenges in relationships is that pleasure is enhanced by novelty.

15. The question isn't whether you're restricted by your partner, but whether you're restricted by the limits of your own imagination.

16. In an optimized relationship with someone, they're inexhaustible, though novelty remains important as part of play.

17. Many people struggle not with actually being with the same person forever, but with the thought of it.

18. People often create a negative story about long-term relationships, imagining becoming unattractive, alienated, and living without romance or excitement.

# 2. Same with appropriate emojis.

"Can you do the outline again, just add grouping and clustering levels (3 total) and make sure each group is numbered independantly and add emojis appropriately around either side of context words representing main idea of concept in at least one word per sentence.  This assists memorization.  Show full markdown code listing.  Also add a mermaid graph with ```mermaid to start the block and ``` at the end each on their own unnumbered lines."
