## Learning ops on topics and perspectives to frame a better truth strucutre in knowledge:

1: Ancestor and Nature worship

2: Preference falsification
https://youtu.be/OHWnPOKh_S0?t=3333

you're now going to have people in the other direction you're going to have people who claim that they supported Trump all along who actually
54:38
didn't right right so it's going to swing the other way and by the way Trump's not the only part of this but
54:43
you know he's just a convenient short hand for you know for for a lot of this um but you know whatever it is you'll you'll have people who will say well I
54:49
never supported Dei right or I never supported ESG or I never thought we should have canceled that person right where of course they were fullon a part
54:55
of the mob like you know kind of at that moment and so anyway so you'll have preference falsification happening in the other direction and and his
55:01
prediction I think basically is you'll end up with the same quote problem on the on the other side now will that
55:07
happen here I don't know you know how far is American society willing to go any of these things I don't know but like there is some some question there
55:14
um and then and then the other part of it is okay now you have this you know Elite that is used to being in power for
55:19
the last decade and and by the way many of those people are still in power and they're in very you know important positions and the New York Times is
55:25
still the New York Times and Harvard is still hared and like those people haven't changed like at all right um and
55:30
they you know they bureaucrats and the government and you know senior Democratic you know politicians and so forth and and they're sitting there you
55:36
know right now feeling like reality has just smacked them hard in the face because they lost the election so badly but they're now going into a and
55:43
specifically the Democratic party is going into a civil war right and and and and and that form of the Civil War is
55:49
completely predictable and it's exactly what's happening which is half of them are saying we need to go back to the center we need to deradicalize because
55:55
we've lost the people we've lost that the people in the middle and so we need to go back to the middle in order to be able to get 50% plus one in an election
56:03
right and then the other half of them are saying no we weren't true to our principles we were too weak we were too soft you know we must become more revolutionary we must double down and we
56:09
must you know celebrate you know murders in the street of health insurance Executives and that's and that that right now is like a real fight if I can
Self-censorship
56:16
tell you a little personal story that breaks my heart a little bit there's uh there's a professor historian I won't
56:22
say who who I admire deeply love his work he's a kind of a heretical thinker
56:28
and we were talking about having a podcast or doing a podcast and he
56:33
eventually said that you know what at this time given your guest list I just don't want the headache of
56:43
being in the faculty meetings in my particular institution and I ask who are
56:48
the particular figures in this guest list he said Trump and the second one he said that
56:56
you announced your interest to talk to Vladimir Putin so I just don't want the
57:01
headache now I I fully believe he uh it would surprise a lot of people if I said who it is but you know this is
