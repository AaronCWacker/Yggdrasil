# Music Writer AI
## Main Idea - AI music understanding and analysis for writing and playing options along with sheet music and chord diagram outputs

Have AI watch a video with lyrics, while also watching a scrolling selection of piano chords and lyrics to be able to generate an output video with lyrics, chords, and analysis of instrument play, singing and lyrics

Goal is only to have a sing along AI which attempts to show anyone who wants to play or sing along with a song to share in the experience without prior knowledge of what lyrics to use or what notes to play, only that each person can watch the output and be able to enjoy while singing or playing along in real time, with an output which would allow musicians to then do the same by memory again without any guidance.

AI training gets all resources together with no instructions.  Multimodal AI understanding of NLP tasks, self supervised training, and AGI methods which include one computer just watching and listening to video of second computer provides the GAN based architecture of player/listener pair programming where one computer shows text, audio, video in multiple browser windows and the AI generator uses attention heads and transformers along with semantic and episodic memory to infer meaning live and in real time as a human would.

# Card Game Design for Developing Mnemonic Memory Techniques to Enhance Semantic and Episodic Memory

This plan is designed to assist creating superhuman memory which is useful for aging adults to circumvent early onset of adult dimensia and to counter effects of alzheimers disease using multiple memory system techniques called **Mnemonics**.  This technique teaches both how to **count cards and how to win** at competitive Blackjack by **improving semantic and emotional (episodic) memory**.

Mnemonics are used for developing **photographic memory capabilities** and to exercise **positive framing Cognitive techniques** which reduce errors in thinking and can help improve lives of sufferers of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, OCD, MDD, and other issues related to neuroscience, psychology and the human brain.

Basis:
By taking a game that most people have heard of and can play, this plan and system is designed to relate new memory key devices to existing memories in order to improve:
1. Imagery and Vizualization
2. Acronyms and Acrostics
3. Rhymes
4. Chunking

These four strategic structures of human brain neural network and synaptic improvements build a solid model making capability where humans bring into conscious planning and solutions superhuman capabilities which strengthen thinking.

The first part of this solution uses a game that some people know the rules well called "Blackjack".  Blackjack can be played with a deck of cards with card regions which describe the following parts:
1. **Inner Card Frame**
   - Size: Approx 65 pixels width by 121 pixels height or roughly 1x2 the inner card form factor with standard playing cards contains a picture visual composed of parts.
      - Parts: Image first is often card inset top of size 65 px by 62 pixels.  This can be square as well.
      - Parts: Image below is often a mirror of image above so that the card reversed looks the same when rotated eliminating need to sort upside down cards for use.  This also lends itself to be able to see same thing when cards are shuffled and upside down.
      - Design: All design of parts should allow use by disabled persons.  Font size of any writing should pass the bifocals test:
         - Bifocals test.  If you have vision problems, cards need to have readable text large enough and simple enough for reading.
	 - If still readable without glasses or vision assistance the cards can be used in low light environments, and by people with fading vision capability.
	 - Midjourney card prompt for inner frame: Lighthouse with Red Diamonds Cloud Pattern high detail Aces --ar 1:2
2. **Outer Card Frame**
   - Size: Approx 100 pixels width by 152 pixels height with proportion of roughly 1 by 1.5 aspect ratio
   - Design: Corners rounded for cut physical cards have a spline middlepoint of four pixels at corner for rounding of corners which allow cards to be more easily handled and shuffled.
   - Font and text: Typically cards have a Color (black or red) a Suit (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades), and a card value which is close to numeric but also identifies face cards which can have additional meaning.  Card Values are as follows:
   1. Ace = 1
   2. 2-10 = Numeric values
   3. J = Jack
   4. Q = Queen
   5. K = King
   6. Optional = Jokers which can also be used as Zero within math number systems.
3. **Deck Size and Card Counting**
   - Deck size can include either 52 or 54 for a standard deck of playing cards.
   - 52 cards in a deck are roughly 13 cards in each of four suits and do not include Jokers / 0.
   - 54 cards in a deck are 13 cards in each of four suits and include Jokers / 0.
   - For mathematics, inclusion of the Joker or zero based number systems allow representation of imaginary numbers.
   - For last 500 years we discovered imaginary numbers are important especially when counting from positives into negatives because the representation of empty sets and null is important in some calculations where a center point between positive and negative is required.  
   - Since four suits and two colors imply a 2D system, there are two zero points (one red Joker, one black Joker)
      1. Left to Right: Horizontal which will be represented by red - a heat scale from cool (Ace) to hot (King).  Hearts and Diamonds are red.
      2. Top to Down: Vertical which will be represented by black - a light scale from dark (Ace) to hot (King). Clubs and Spades are black.
      3. Red versus Black allows teams of two which can be two players or one player and one AI.
      4. Red and Black also allow a binary measurement then of heat and light, which can also be used to represent Mass and Agency
   - Ikigai - a term which refers to four dimensions will be used to emotionally load differences between Suits:
      1. Hearts or Love is Positive therefore from 0 red Joker to K hearts will represent horizontally Left
      2. Diamonds or Riches is negative from 0 red joker to K diamonds will representing horizontally Right
      3. Clubs or Groups of people is positive therefore from 0 black Joker to K clubs will represent vertical Up
      4. Spades or Work is negative from 0 black Joker to King of Spades vertical Down
   - Ikigai has four quadrants.  These are ties to emotional memory and happiness by our purpose in life:
      1. Up (Clubs) - What the world needs - Agency - As we work together in larger groups we increase exponentially in capability.
      2. Down (Spades) - What you are good at - Mass - As we go into a microcosm, even dig down to center of earth, mass and gravity increases.
      3. Left (Hearts) - What you love - In the beginning we are product of love between two people.
      4. Right (Diamonds) - What you get paid for - In the end we accumulate resources and ability to help others.
   - Ikigai quadrants can also specify "Air vs Earth - Up to Down, and Water vs Fire - Left to Right"
4. **Tarot and Action Rules**
   - In the Tarot decks you have 22 value cards.  These cards have values which symbolically represent progression of life
   - Birth - Starting at Zero - Perfect beginning.
   - Death - Ending at 21 - Perfect ending.
   - These Tarot major arcana originated in Celtic systems to describe progressions of the circle of life.
   - Dealing cards in Blackjack (21) and odds of actions to win ratio:
      1. Wizardofodds.com has an odds table containing distinct clusters of recommended actions
      2. Clusters include:
         - H) Hit - Request for dealer to give me more cards
         - S) Stand - Let it ride - I believe I can win with this hand
         - Dh) Double if allowed otherwise hit
         - Ds) Double if allowed otherwise stand
         - P) Split
      3. Four Sub-Clusters exist:
         - Ph - Split if double after split is allowed, otherwise hit
         - Rh - Surrender if allowed, otherwise hit
         - Rs - Surrender if allowed, otherwise stand
         - Rp - Surrender if allowed, otherwise split
5. Getting Started - Sort the Cards
   - Sort Cards In Order and By Suit into Quadrants
   - Black will be up and down
   - Red will be left and right
   - Two Jokers go in Center
6. Once Sorted by Suit, Order Cards from Ace to King
   - Top : 1,2,3,4,5  6,7,8,9,10   J,Q,K   Clubs
   - Bottom: 1,2,3,4,5  6,7,8,9,10  J,Q,K   Spades
   - Left: 1,2,3,4  5,6,7,8  9,10,J,Q,K   Hearts
   - Right: 1,2,3,4  5,6,7,8  9,10,J,Q,k   Diamonds
   - The groupings shown are to accommodate chunking of contiguous elements into one.
   - This mnemonic will also allow chunking to activate neural network chaining and compression where if you know one thing in sequence it leads to another.
   - Uneven grouping allow you to easily know and remember suit
   - Red and Hearts/Diamonds will end with 5- 5 fingers to Trigger recency a mnemonic which lets you most remember what occurred recently in time.
   - Black and Clubs/Spades will center with 5- 5 fingers to Trigger Visual alignment of symmetry which represents mnemonic of beauty where we remember what is beautiful to us.
   - Use the Ikigai or Suit words to modify the visual picture.
      - If for example you are using 9 of hearts to remember keys location on nite table, your visual picture might be:
      - A love cat purring on the nitestand wearing keys around collar jingling as cat dances on top of table.
      - The more interesting, colorful picture you imagine, the stronger the memory will be.
      - By using the modifiers of suits you can then create easy to remember variants of same pegwords without requiring more words.
      - This system should then allow memorizing lists of up to 52 things.
      - If you are remembering multiple lists per day break the lists thematically into the four categories and use those consistently.
      - Choose which suit to use at onset and say it aloud (e.g. for work related use spades, for things about family use hearts..)

7. Peg word system and training base images.
   - Image word systems allow you to create a peg word or word which triggers a visual picture in your memory
   - With this special set of Cards the outer frame is maintained for compatibility with card systems.
   - The inner frame is replaced with these pictures which use at least one form of Mnemonic:

Peg word (Keyword) System Example - Use These or pick your own picture words:
1. Lighthouse - It looks like a 1.
2. Glasses - How many lenses?  2.
3. Stool - How many legs?  3.
4. Window - How many panes?  4.
5. Hand - How many fingers?  5.
6. Dice - How many sides?  6.
7. Heaven or Clouds - Why?  It rhymes.
8. Gate - Why?  It rhymes.
9. Cat - Why?  Cats have nine lives.
10. Toes - Why?  You have ten toes.
11. Jack with Drum sticks - Why - Two drum sticks look like 11.
12. Queen is Boxing - Why?  We have two hands/fists and the one two punch is left right.  Queen is best fighter in Chess.
13. King with Mask - Why?  Sensational or scary things are easy to remember.  Crown makes up Mask.  King being highest card per suit is fearsome.

Math: 13 * 4 = 52 card deck..

Process: 
When attempting to memorize, have these cards pre associated with something you can see in your mind.
With new words or subjects you are remembering blend these into the picture and remember with imagery using imagination to remember in a sequence.
Test the memory by stepping through each in order.
Speak and describe the images you see when remembering.
When recalling, speak and say name of card or number.
Use suit images of Heart (love) Diamond (riches) Club (needs) and Spades (work) to modify your internal picture.
You can then remember anything in order easily recalling by going through them.  Test it.
If you miss one, go on but look up answer and add something into picture that you recall or make it more sensational.
Try writing it down while reading it aloud, the combination of more than one type of input and output will add to memory strength.
Test once, let it go, do something else.  Later come back and number on paper and retest what you remember associated with the pegwords.
Rehearsing once immediately and once after letting your mind wander should be enough to reinforce the memory.
To blend semantic and episodic memory try adding things that create an emotional response for you into the picture and also use language, rhyming, etc to increase language ties to memory which will use both semantic and episodic memory.

# Mnemonics

Mnemonics can be used to give yourself a planned photographic memory which is useful to memorize large lists of any subject.

There are four main types of mnemonic devices that help you get the most out of your memory.  These can be used to circumvent memory problems we encounter as we age including providing a pre-planned circumvention of the condition known as early onset of adult dimensia in which we slowly loose our memory and ability to easily memorize new facts we encounter.
1) **Imagery and Visualization.** 
	Our brains remember images much more easily than words or sounds.
	Translating things you want to remember into mental images can be a great mnemonic device.
2) **Acronyms and Acrostics.**
	When we read we often detect what the word will be based on context so often we only need the first 1-3 letters to figure out a word in a sentence.
	This concept is used in speed reading and grokking which is accelerated memorization using the capabilities of visual acuity and semantic memory.
3) **Rhymes.**
	Ability to remember lyrics and music is powerful as well as rhyming words which can trigger a self audio recall.
	This often also depends on the capability of our audio memory to respond naturally to emotion which is episodic memory.
4) **Chunking.**
	Chunking is a natural way that we build models in the neocortex.  When we chunk we remember things due to given context like fill in the blank.
	Chunking can reduce the amount of required space to store a memory.  Chunking that involves three dimensions is useful for memory that is syntactic in nature.
	
The keyword mnemonic technique combines these four into a strategy which uses numbered keywords that excite visual memory.  When you encounter something you want to remember.  Add it to a visualization that includes a visual memory that you have stored and numbered.  Then when excercising recall, go either backwards or forwards through the numbered images to recall what you added to the imaginative picture in your mind.

Numbered Image Keywords 0 - 21 (22 item length list)
0 - Dreamer
1 - Magician
2 - Priestess
3 - Empress
4 - Emporer
5 - Unity
6 - Lovers
7 - Chariot
8 - Justice
9 - Hermit
10 - Wheel
11 - Strength
12 - Awakening
13 - Release
14 - Balance
15 - Ego
16 - Experience
17 - Star
18 - Moon
19 - Sun
20 - Renewal
21 - World

These image generating words are just a sample - feel free to choose your own that are meaningful to you.  The more outrageous or emotion exciting for you the better they will serve you as an internal keyword list that you can combine the imagery with the item you want to remember.

# Behavioral Health Best Practices

1) Integrate medical and behavioral care
2) Payment,AdminBurden, RespectProfessin (FamilyDoctor w Med treatment, side symptoms of BH in family situation)
3) Larger - if medical issue, yet also suffer depression - send to phys w another specialty - not working on small scale
4) Admin burdern - documentation - clinical side of it, payment side of it
5) Services require full staff, full team
6) Rural area - no luxury of multiple psych, provide in home
7) physician access model, business case for decisions
8) value based outcome model
9) Improved outcomes for hypertension, diabetes, chronic disease, and make sure patient is healthy
10) Following medication adherence, decrease in ER visits, decrease increased hospitalization
11) This all adds into shared savings -> business model is to pay attention
12) Right thing for patients is quality service - happy and healthy lives.
13) Value based payment model, Social Determinants of Health - drives 70% of outcomes - Achieve health equity
14) Staff shortages - public health emergencies, Recovery program telehealth, face to face shortages
15) Individuals to provide counseling in our area
16) Workflow, telehealth, screening in person - how, staff understand tech
17) Study your population - know your data, to support stories so you know how much of an impact is undiagnosed, or untreated
18) Is it depression, anxiety, substance use disorder - create baseline.
19) Workflow, pull team together, create plan how to ID and address needs of patient
20) Look at our performance - are we making a difference, markers getting rid of severity of condition
21) Review pop data, review support groups - Celebrate Recovery, AA, Health Dept, Care360-Access resources for people who need it, food deserts, housing issues, plays into MH issues

# BH Federal Support
1) Deploy programs to reduce substance use and increase BH interventions
2) Validated screening and assessment tools at trouble (jail, ER, discharge) to ID and track untreated BH conditions
3) Racial equity - support evidence based prevention efforts to reduce youth substance use, reduce supply of illicit substances
4) Expand treatment programs and other behavioral health interventions 
5) Collaborative crisis response and intervention training
6) Training for response, opiate substance and stimulant abuse programs
7) Resources - MH Collaboration Toolkit, MH Learning sites, National conferences, Best practice guide
8) Family treatment resources, residential substance abuse treatment programs
9) Healthy homes - identify help at family scale, resources for families
10) Drug court, veterans treatment, peer review

# Complex Conditions and BH
1) Increase remission of depression
2) Data reporting accuracy - depression assessments, gaps in depression data
3) Depression tookit, Coping, Living and Thriving despite disease
4) Facility feedback, depression toolkits

# Depression - Options
1) Physicians write prescriptions yet how to plan and deal as individuals
2) Nature of addiction - numb pain.  Serious side effects, Psychotherapy talk therapy
3) What makes you feel good, what makes you feel bad
4) Situation - what to do, giving up on something you want causes depression
5) Pinpoint the problem.  When you feel powerless, back up, identify bump, pump up, problem solve
6) Video screen in mind, Image of what you are mad at, identify and point it, explain why you are mad.
7) Identify what you want in that circumstance, disorders of power - pinpoint problem
8) Take breath, feel yourself stronger, more powerful, stronger
9) Problem solve - scenario solution, what could you do to feel better, stronger, new ideas
10) Visualization, different solutions, try new, see what you do differently,humility, how feel, bigger, brighter, lighter, techniques and write questions.


# Image Generation for Art, Marketing, Ideation, Design, and Use in Business

A number of multiple AI pipeline element strategies have evolved on the open market which allow you to generate images using a combination of image prompts and word prompts.  This brief analysis gives an idea of the prompting capabilities as well as image rendering techniques that are used in the strategy to generate art from human understanding of images and text used to describe a scene.

First a top five list on state of the art generators both free and paid is worth consideration.

1) Midjourney - a Discord server based chatboat AI that allows /imagine prompts which can generate multiple images at a time.  This is best at parallel creation, high accuracy even photo real creations.
2) Artbreeder - A multiple capability tool which now features a Collager which assists in starting image composition.  By far the most innovative approach which does great to combine the right partial elements in a scene.
3) Dreamstudio - A Huggingface derived art program in beta which uses stable diffusion to create highly accurate art and images.
4) Nightcafe - A credit based creation AI app that can do generation of video dives into an AI art piece which can produce some of the best experiences in Video.
5) RunwayML - a quintessential tool in processing morph audio and video tracks which rival most high end video edit tools.

These 5 tools make up some of the best AI pipeline programs that are cloud based that allow anyone to begin easily building their portfolio of art.

The prompting capabilities often involve having a set of text based prompts to get started.  Most also feature a starter image which could be an example of what you would like to create.

## Getting Started and Organizing Your AI Pipeline and Process

Any great strategy has a number of steps that combine all capabilities at your disposal.  It is useful to note how you can easily fir these together into a process that works for you.

The techniques worth noted are listed below.  Consider how you will use them will make your pipeline easier and more automated to allow you to spend the majority of your time curating what you have made, and ideating what you want to create next.

1) Source materials: Since prompting requires text and text examples can quickly help you compose good input, its worth considering and documenting some effective prompts.  Nightcafe with its integration into email, sends you a copy of your creation plus the prompting text so one option is to use your email account to keep a record of which prompts work for which outputs.
2) Source materials:  Discord since its a public chat format allows you to easily see what others are using for prompts in bulk.  There are a number of chat channels designed for people new to the platform and often you can copy and paste if you see very effective prompts with material you are looking for.
3) Source materials: Collager is unique in its ability to add additive parts and then dial in the percent of AI you would like with that.  This allows you to add a few image elements which help start out your generation.  
4) Source materials: Since images and prompts are going to be your mainstay for inputs its worth considering an open standard for storing and retrieving these from anywhere.  Github is a good place since markdown language can involve text in table or list format and includes a capability to reference uploaded images within markdown.  This is also a good form for portability since you can later fork and download your repository with a few clicks from anywhere.
5) Source materials: Google drive is integrated into the Artbreeder Collager workflow which allows you easily expand your work and even compose albums of the ones you like to place in Google photo albums.  The portfolio you save on different sites have different degrees of ease when aggregating your collections.  Collager for instance allows right click save for instant saving of your creation.  Dreamstudio features a history.  Midjourney features a profile site for you to store and review creations even triggering Upscales which important to use to get the highest resolution output for your creations.

##  Social Media integration

Depending on your target "safe for work" exports of your work, it is sometimes important to know your accepted social media outlets that you can integrate.  Cloud based interactions are the key to successful audiences if you want to scale and share your process with others.

The key social media outlets supported for these tools are here in a sorted link list which start with public open source first:

1) Github - Github is open at most companies and allow creation of a free space to share your content.
2) LinkedIn - LinkedIn is acceptable use at nearly every company.
3) Twitter - Twitter is supported as a social media outlet at most companies yet can also be used with security restrictions which might limit posting but allow read access.
4) Facebook - Meta's Facebook is a good outlet since it allows creation of large folios of your images along with stories.  This venue however is locked down at many organizations.
5) Instagram - Instagram is supported as an output channel for many tools yet has decreased in popularity due to high frequency of ads and pay for likes models.  While it can still be one of the best places for domain specific arrangements of images it is likely locked down in most secure organizations.
6) Youtube - For video uploads with automated captioning and long term storage of short and long form video this is an essential for any creation you compose as video.  It is also useful to review and compose playlists of videos here for yourself that speed up your learning - Spend some time at Youtube university and keep a record of keyword searches there sometimes along with your playlists to accelerate learning.
7) Gmail - With the baility to move email in and out its useful to create and wrap up details within email.  Most email policies come with a content limitation (for example no files larger than 25MB.  For this reason get used to creating pproject wrap up archives with winzip or compression software.  With the convenience of keyword searching you can usually use this as a base.
8) Last a worth mention is Huggingface.com.  Like github as you become more sophisticated in your public open source capabilities, HuggingFace can allow you to wrap up using one of three software development kits which are gadio, streamlit, and HTML5 each with unique AI and UI integration components and features.  If you want to create your own AI pipelines this one also has the open source code and models ready to go to help you on your journey.


# Chords and Lyrics

Music we remember with our emotional center of the brain called the Amygdala, a center where the newer brain neocortex is still wrapping it like a pearl in an oyster.  The emotional center of our brain is the center of emotional intelligence.  We have two types of memories, semantic like words and your address.  The second type is episodic memory where like what we love and yearn for and remember associated with emotions, feelings, and sentiment.  Music has a direct call line to our emotional memory which has served humanity well in ritual ensuring survival of our species across the last 80k or so years as we traveled as tribes up from Africa, through India, to Europe and then across the ocean to the Americas.

Dreams of magic, and power within music enlighten us, sometimes helping us to understand and plan our place in the future.  What we share if useful and worth spreading, becoming ideas we give away for free and help others find their way because of similarity of plot and struggle.

Life is hard, yet music for our human love of life is a shared way in which we intrigue our brain where the grind becomes a beautiful thing we love to retry and figure out.

For this reason I document some of my favorite music to play.  Lately the band Wolf Alice appeals to me due to their beautiful vocals and the way the band loves the audience and treats eachother with empathy.  Each member of the band has a great way of giving honor to the playing of keyboard, guitar, drums, and the singing.  The words of their lyrics are very special and help us understand our creator, our flaws, what we love and what we are sorry for.  The feel of the music gives us the ability to forgive shortcomings.

On this Sunday my prayer is for anyone in the struggle, to look to elders and yet when we live complicated lives, we gain from singing old songs.

She's a good girl.

# Quantum AI for Health
Quantum computing can run structural biology and AI simulations down to a quantum and molecular level.  Calculations can run in seconds to solve problems that previously took years.  This advantage in being able to make new discoveries using simulation.  This with support of transformers a technique which runs in classical computing can use the quantum aspect to optimize design of new medicines and materials by using SMILES.  The computations at a quantum and molecular level is solved as language using the pairing of a compound drug code and the selection and bonding reactions when two compunds are combined and match bonds in three dimensions.

Two tools are part of this invention, a quantum modeler application located here:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/AI-Quantum

And the classical part of the AI which supplies the language corpus of SMILES implemented as 2D and 3D models is located here:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/ChemistryModelerSMILES

Info about SMILES: https://archive.epa.gov/med/med_archive_03/web/html/smiles.html

Learn about it at Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system

Search for any compound on PubChem at National Library of Medicine: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#query=vitamin%20e

Top 3 designs in SMILES code:
Chloroquine : CCN(CC)CCCC(C)NC1=C2C=CC(=CC2=NC=C1)Cl
Fingolimod : CCCCCCCCC1=CC=C(C=C1)CCC(CO)(CO)N
Favipiravir : C1=C(N=C(C(=O)N1)C(=O)N)F

The transformers technique uses similar architecture on classical side as Alphafold2 used for protein folding solutions.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7wJDJ56c88

Transformers on classical side feed the possible selection and bonds of SMILES single character words with quantum random substitutions which are then evaluated in 3D molecule interaction by simulating the bonds between the designed drug and the target such as DNA or RNA including architecture of viruses and target disease related compounds.  The RL self play portion is fitness factor scoring by Rx experts in the field evaluating results of simulation runs.

# AutoNLP from Transcripts

AI use in transcript analysis offers the capability to automatically summarize, extract entities, understand and score things like bias and sentiment, and also unlock complex memory enhancement which could keep track of things in context related to what you know or are interested in then to personalize the subject matter in order to help you augment your intelligence.

For this purpose there are five transcripts below.  Goal is to create an AI pipeline that could assist with understanding content in a self supervised fashion just by example.  This is a form of instruction using large language models, Seq2Seq NLP Task, MLM NLP Task, Generators, and Transformers together in an AI Pipeline that breaks apart useful information and commits it to memory for you to review later forming an AI agent that helps you learn what you care about.

Transcripts are titled AutoNLPTranscript-AIinScienceFictionandFuturistVisions referring to the fact that thinking creatively about subject matter of possibilities mixed with reality creates a fertile ground for knowledge engineering.

As much as possible results will be shown as markdown per the tips on Markdown Cheatsheet located here:  https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

# Floating Concrete Docks

In the US a ship SS Anderson was one of the first concrete boats.  A concrete pier or boat will last forever, will always be faithfully stable, can float and can offer optimal crossing from land to sea.  Standing fleet of metal or wood require constant upkeep.  Concrete when floating is the ideal solution.

## Love and Music

One of the struggles in life is loving yourself and feeling that you are deserving.  Complexity and nuance in relationships make you think.

I'm listening and playing music alot daily and these are some of the musicians that I play their songs, melodies, lyrics and all the first time choosing to order them by meaning found while playing.  Musicians that write, sing and perform music inspire me.  These musicians each leave a huge mark on music for all, inspiring millions and billions of people around the world to love and to enjoy music together.

Each song has an appeal in some way across:
1) Lyrics
2) Melody & Voice
3) Music

Here is my "play it next" list with a quick link to each set of lyrics and chords together which you need as a musician to play it right away.  Thankyou musicians for sharing the great beauty of the world.

## Artists of the Day - 6/7/2022
My family/friend Dennis who is 94 stopped by walking the island the other day and brought Sam and I four albums, along with a wish of love.  The artists were Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, John Prine, and Eydie Gorme.  With my daily music challenge of playing at least three songs per day of each artist I am interesting learning to play them first time through this is my list for today.

## General Purpose Languages
W3C Recommendations and HL7 FHIR are the frameworks we use for web languages.	|	https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rdf.html

A key theme in 2022 is Knowledge Representation in AI, Use of NLP to augment and assist language, and Web2 the use of microservices and platform SDKs and frameworks into simplified, high performance tech forward solutions that are loosely coupled and web based.

To be useful for both humans and machines the form of knowledge representation must be terse, meaning it is short and contains everything you would need to understand the text, the fields on what they contain and the structure which maps entities to values for example "Heart" is a part of a "Body".  "Lung" is also part of a "Body".

## RDF
The Resource Description Framework or RDF is a general purpose language for representing language on the web.

RDF is often referred to as a "Triple" language which means it can allow structure to exist consisting of a:
1) Subject
2) Predicate
3) Object

RDF format allows us to bridge operational data exchange and formal knowledge processing to be able to share data easily between humans and machines without loosing structure and without creating cognitive burden allowing the data to be read by humans or machines.

When impedance differences show up it makes it difficult to use a language in both contexts.  To minimize these complications we strive to reconcile the records across time and perspective.  In Health Care it is important to be recording records versus facts for example who did what ("Dr. AllCome diagnosed patient x with COVID19") rather than stating absolute medical facts ("patient x has viral pneumonia").

A simple example in context of Physical Health might be:
Subject	|	Predicate	|	Object
--------|---------------|-------------
<http://health.org/#Heart>  |	<http://health.org/IsPartOf> 	|	<http://health.org/#Body> 
<http://health.org/#Lung>  |	<http://health.org/IsPartOf> 	|	<http://health.org/#Body> 

The triple sequence like a sentence is separated by whitespace and terminated by a period.

RDF Turtle is used in FHIR to be able to round trip serialization patterns between different languages including XML and JSON which are used in web services and web applications.

## Enter the Human!
For human understanding, the ability to be minimal, terse and still maintain structure is key to language.  
For this reason even the above simple example is not reduced to a dense enough structure where it is readily understandable without training.

If we simplified format with Symbols a possible more terse more human understandable format would not loose structure. 

What might that look like?

Option	|	Advantages/Disadvantages	|	Example
--------|---------------|-------------
Markdown	|	Standard	|	https://github.com/topics/markdown
FHIR		|	Standard	|	https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rdf.html
RDF		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/
Dictionary	|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_nested.asp
Sets		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp
Tuples		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp
Lists		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp
Lambda		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp
Variables	|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_multiple.asp


e.g. Pipe delimiters are nice yet you cannot read the label easily inline and you loose structure:
BodyParts|Heart|Lung
Colon and semicolons are used within text frequently by humans so delimiters are easily corrupted:
: ;
Programmatic language symbols work well.  But if you mix them it becomes harder for humans to decipher the parts
{, ", = , }, </>
HL7 v2.5.x had it pretty good since once you understood a few symbols it is easier to read..  One limitation tho is labeling becomes overly burdensome however structurally it is terse.
Unicode emojis work well: https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/Emoji-Short-Codes

An RDF like simplification that uses a few symbols might allow for an optimally terse representation that has inline labels for Subject, Predicate, Object

If we want to make it easier to read for humans, we would want to simulate the two types of Memory humans use.
It is worth considering properties of Semantic and Episodic memory since data and knowledge representation exist to communicate and persist to memory what we want to communicate.

## Definitions:

ep·i·sod·ic mem·o·ry
noun	PSYCHOLOGY
a type of long-term memory that involves conscious recollection of previous experiences together with their context in terms of time, place, associated emotions, etc.
"those results suggest that participants were using episodic memory to recall the presented words in all conditions"
a conscious memory of a previous experience.
"the hippocampus is critically involved in forming episodic memories"

se·man·tic mem·o·ry
noun	PSYCHOLOGY
a type of long-term memory involving the capacity to recall words, concepts, or numbers, which is essential for the use and understanding of language.
"if patients lose semantic memory, they struggle with knowledge of everyday objects in the world, and have trouble communicating"
a recollection of a word, concept, or number.
"the extraction of semantic memories and associated emotions"


## Nine properties of Episodic Memory
There are essentially nine properties of episodic memory that collectively distinguish it from other types of memory. Other types of memory may exhibit a few of these properties, but only episodic memory has all nine.  Episodic m

Contain summary records of sensory-perceptual-conceptual-affective processing.
Retain patterns of activation/inhibition over long periods.
Often represented in the form of (visual) images.
They always have a perspective (field or observer).
Represent short time slices of experience.
They are represented on a temporal dimension roughly in order of occurrence.
They are subject to rapid forgetting.
They make autobiographical remembering specific.
They are recollectively experienced when accessed.


## Options for a Terse Knowledge Representation Structure For Easy Understanding

Dictionaries are represented within Python code using a minimal structure similar to RDF.  For example in our RDF example above there are three parts, the Subject, the Predice and the Object.  That plus an ability to compose a list of records delimited by period allows you to represent a list of records that can either be a graph or a list of N dimensions.

A dictionary is ordered changeable and does not allow duplicates and can be represented like this:
Parts = {
  "Body": "Heart",
  "location": "Chest"
}
Nested Dictionaries allow similar representing Health Conditions across People:
UpperAbdomen = {
  "PartofBodyForPerson1" : {
    "Heart" : "Excellent",
    "Lung" : "Excellent"
  },
  "PartofBodyForPerson2" : {
    "Heart" : "Excellent",
    "Lung" : "Excellent"
  }
}

Super simple yet understandable structures can then be optimal yet the constraint would need to be to not allow any symbolic delimiter within data in order to avoid adding the complexity of escape sequences.  So programmatically understanding data as code could be most descriptive and fluid while being advantageous to trade of to succinct terse implementation:

Two liner, self explanatory, expects data does not contain symbols: {":, to keep it simple.
CarExample = {"brand": "Ford",  "model": "Mustang",  "year": 1964}
print(CarExample["brand"])

# Storyteller Myths, Legends, Deities, and Demigods
Type | URL
------------ | -------------
Tengu	|	tengu, in Japanese folklore, a type of mischievous supernatural being, sometimes considered the reincarnated spirit of one who was proud and arrogant in life. Tengu are renowned swordsmen and are said to have taught the military arts to the Minamoto hero Yoshitsune. They live in trees in mountainous areas.
Cernnunos	|	Cernunnos was the Gaelic god of beasts and wild places. Often called the Horned One, Cernunnos was a mediator of man and nature, able to tame predator and prey so they might lie down together. He remains a mysterious deity, as his original mythos has been lost to history.
Samhain	|	It was believed that ringing a bell on Samhain kept away evil spirits. Burying animal bones in front of your house on the night of Samhain will keep evil away, according to some legends of eastern Europe. Samhain is a good time of year to work on communicating with the spirit world.
Elken | In some Pacific Northwest tribes, elk are also considered to be particular protectors of women, and in some legends elk lead women who had been captured by enemy warriors back to their homes. In Plains Indian tribes, elk were associated with masculinity, endurance, and bravery, and elks' eyeteeth were highly valued both as objects of adornment and as the symbol of a man's hunting prowess. In some Plains tribes, men saved the eyeteeth from their first elk kill to make into engagement jewelry for their sweetheart. In others, the number of elk teeth sewn onto a woman's dress showed off the wealth and skill of her husband or father. Elk are associated with coneflowers in some Great Basin tribes, such as the Ute, who refer to coneflowers as "elk root."
Ah Puch	|	Ah Puch is one of the names associated with a god of death in the ancient Mayan religion. He was known as a god of death, darkness, and disaster. But he was also a god of childbirth and beginnings. The Quiche Maya believed that he ruled over Metnal, the underworld and the Yucatec Maya believed that he was just one of the lords of Xibaba, that translates to "place of fear" in the underworld.
Nu Wa	|	Nüwa was the one who patched the holes in Heaven with five colored stones, and she used the legs of a tortoise to mend the pillars. There are many instances of her in literature across China which detail her in creation stories, and today remains a figure important to Chinese culture.

Meaning of Life Symposium (Manolis Kellis):

The beauty of the human genome
Coming up on 50th birthday, get together with friends to discuss the meaning of life
What is the meaning of life?

Meaning of life symposium means - sym (together) posi (drink) so  symposium = drinking party
42 is answer (Hitchikers Guide)

Give seven minute species on meaning of life
	I dont know what the meaning of life is but....
	All mutually synergistic
	Difference between purpose and meaning
	Linguistics Harvard - Very Pythian answer.  Pythia oracle "Answer is become one.  

Like a child become one year old everything new, 
drive yourself to perfection in all your tests, 
when people are separate, come together as one and support eachother.

Why life itself?
	is it inevitable
	about physics
	transcends physics
	distinct entity in universe
	forces, is it another force, lifeforce
	a new software or layer of a computer system

Gratitude
	During this pandemic we worked alot breaking all boundaries of where personal life begins
	Intellectual pleasure in day of exhaustion
	Wow I was useful today, feeling pleasure and grateful today.  
	Thankyou for all you have given me and grant me the strength to give to others the way you have given to me.
	I love this.  Me in most unfiltered way to do something useful and interact with aspects
	Discover aspects of AI, ML .. that nobody has seen before with data we capture which has never been observed
	As a father teaching my kids the understanding they have of world around us and me too
	Unfiltered criticism from a child knows no dishonesty, immense love and passion.
	We as adults learn how to hide so much better
	Raw emotions that make a human being
	To become truly human results.
	Complexity of language grow as more neural networks are connected, frontal cortex forming for 10 years
	Incredible that the knowledge fed throughout shaping neural nets as forming
	Most beautiful thing to do which completes me.
	Decades of compassion, sharing, anger, patience, as a parent you become a very different kind of teacher
	Learning process of sharing, conveying knowledge, encapsulating the complex, and giving bite size chunks society can appreciate.
