# 📥 Ingress vs Egress

1. 📥 Ingress
   - 🌐 External Traffic
      - Incoming traffic from users, clients, or other services outside the network
      - Accessing resources within the network or system (e.g., API, web services)
   - 🔒 Internal Traffic
      - Communication between components within the network or system (e.g., microservices)
      - Typically restricted access for improved security

2. 📤 Egress
   - 🌐 External Traffic
      - Outgoing traffic from the network or system to users, clients, or other services
      - Sending responses or data to external entities
   - 🔒 Internal Traffic
      - Communication between components within the network or system (e.g., microservices)
      - Typically restricted access for improved security
    
For Ingress: Azure Container Apps supports HTTPS and TCP types of ingress.

With HTTPS ingress enabled container apps support TLS, HTTP/1.1 and 2, Websocket, gRPC.  TLS1.2 is used for HTTPS.  Endpoints expose port 80, 443.  80 is redirected to 443.  App accessed on FQDN.  Request timeout is 240 seconds.

## ChatGPT - Tasks

description of the standards, covering HL7 v2.x, FHIR, EDI, and others in a markdown table:

Standard	Description	Examples	Libraries
HL7 v2.x	Health Level Seven version 2.x is a widely used messaging standard for exchanging healthcare data between systems. It uses a pipe-and-hat format to transmit messages like patient admissions, orders, and results.	ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer), ORM (Order), ORU (Observation Result)	hl7apy, python-hl7
FHIR	Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources is a modern standard for exchanging healthcare data using RESTful APIs. It defines modular "resources" to represent various healthcare entities, allowing flexibility and interoperability.	Patient, Encounter, Observation, DiagnosticReport, AllergyIntolerance	fhir.resources, fhirclient
EDI 278	Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standard 278 is used for transmitting healthcare service information, like prior authorizations and referrals. It includes two substandards: 278A (Request) and 278N (Response).	278A (Request for Review), 278N (Response to Request for Review)	pyx12, edi3tools
IHE XDS	Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (XDS) is a standard for sharing clinical documents between different healthcare organizations in a secure and interoperable manner.	XDS (Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing), XDS-I (Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing for Imaging)	IHE-XDS-Client, pyxds
LOINC	Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) is a universal code system for identifying laboratory and clinical observations.	LOINC codes (e.g., 2160-0 for Serum Creatinine)	loinc2hpo, loinc-parser
SNOMED CT	Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is a comprehensive and standardized vocabulary for clinical terminology in healthcare.	SNOMED CT codes (e.g., 840539006 for COVID-19)	snomedct, snomed-ct-parser
To read and write observations, CCDs, and other formats using libraries, you can follow these examples:

Observations with HL7 v2.x (ORU message):

import hl7
from hl7apy.parser import parse_message

message = "MSH|^~\&|...|ORU^R01|..."  # Replace with a valid HL7 v2.x message
parsed_message = parse_message(message, validation_level='TOLERANT')

# Read an observation
observation = parsed_message.get_segments('OBX')[0]
value = observation['OBX.5']['OBX.5.1'].value
units = observation['OBX.6']['OBX.6.1'].value

# Write an observation
new_observation = hl7.Segment("OBX")
new_observation.set_fields([
    "OBX",
    "1",
    "NM",
    "2160-0^Serum Creatinine^LN",
    "",
    "1.2",
    "mg/dL",
    "0.6-1.3",
    "N",
    "",
    "F",
    "20210508000000"
])
parsed_message.add_segment(new_observation)

CCDs with Python CDA Library:

from lxml import etree
from python_cda import CDA

xml = """<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ClinicalDocument xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3">
    <!-- CCD content goes here -->
</ClinicalDocument>"""

# Read CCD
tree = etree.fromstring(xml)
ccd = CDA(tree)

# Access patient information
patient = ccd.record_target.patient_role.patient
given_name = patient.name.given
family_name = patient.name.family

# Access medication section
medications = ccd.component.structured_body.component[0].section.entry

# Write CCD
new_ccd = CDA()
new_ccd.set_element("realmCode", code="US")
new_ccd.set_element("typeId", root="2.16.840.1.113883.1.3", extension="POCD_HD000040")

# Add patient information, medication section, etc. to the new CCD


Observations with FHIR:

from fhir.resources import Observation, Quantity

# Read observation from JSON
json_data = {
  "resourceType": "Observation",
  "status": "final",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://loinc.org",
        "code": "2160-0",
        "display": "Serum Creatinine"
      }
    ]
  },
  "valueQuantity": {
    "value": 1.2,
    "unit": "mg/dL",
    "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
    "code": "mg/dL"
  }
}
observation = Observation(json_data)

# Access observation values
value = observation.valueQuantity.value
units = observation.valueQuantity.unit

# Write observation
new_observation = Observation.construct()
new_observation.status = "final"
new_observation.code = {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://loinc.org",
        "code": "2160-0",
        "display": "Serum Creatinine"
      }
    ]
}
new_observation.valueQuantity = Quantity.construct()
new_observation.valueQuantity.value = 1.2
new_observation.valueQuantity.unit = "mg/dL"
new_observation.valueQuantity.system = "http://unitsofmeasure.org"
new_observation.valueQuantity.code = "mg/dL"

Short example with markdown:

**Knee Replacement:** The patient is a 65-year-old male presenting with severe **knee pain** and stiffness in the left knee. The patient's pain has been progressively worsening, and he now experiences difficulty walking and climbing stairs. Physical examination reveals significant **functional impairment** and crepitus during knee flexion. X-ray imaging shows advanced **osteoarthritis** with **joint space narrowing** and **bone-on-bone** contact. There is also evidence of **knee deformity** and **joint degeneration**. The patient has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without success. Considering the patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings, a total knee replacement is recommended to improve the patient's quality of life and mobility.

**Hip Replacement:** A 70-year-old female patient presents with chronic left **hip pain** and difficulty walking. The patient reports a history of worsening pain over the past two years, with limited response to conservative treatments. Physical examination reveals **limited mobility** and **hip stiffness**. The patient's gait is antalgic, and she is unable to perform a straight leg raise due to pain. X-ray imaging of the left hip joint demonstrates severe **hip osteoarthritis** with significant **joint space narrowing**, **bone-on-bone** contact, and **hip deformity**. Given the patient's debilitating symptoms, **functional impairment**, and failure to respond to conservative treatment, a total hip replacement is recommended to relieve pain and restore function.


Long example with markdown:





**Knee Replacement:** Mr. Johnson, a 65-year-old male, presented to the clinic with a history of worsening left **knee pain** that began about three years ago. The patient has tried multiple conservative treatments, including physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, and corticosteroid injections. However, these treatments provided only temporary relief, and his pain has continued to worsen. The patient now experiences difficulty walking, climbing stairs, and performing daily activities due to the severity of the pain. During the physical examination, Mr. Johnson's left knee joint exhibited significant **functional impairment** with limited range of motion, crepitus during flexion, and a positive McMurray's test. The patient's medical history included obesity and type 2 diabetes, which may have contributed to the **joint degeneration**. Mr. Johnson's pain has affected his quality of life, causing sleep disturbances and difficulty in maintaining an active lifestyle.

Radiographic assessment of the left knee joint revealed advanced **osteoarthritis** with substantial **joint space narrowing**, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation. There was also evidence of **bone-on-bone** contact and **knee deformity** in the form of varus angulation. A series of weight-bearing x-rays were performed, which confirmed the severity of the degenerative changes. Laboratory tests ruled out the presence of an inflammatory condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the lack of response to conservative treatments, Mr. Johnson was referred to an orthopedic surgeon for a total knee replacement evaluation. The surgeon discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and his family. After considering the available options, the patient decided to proceed with the total knee replacement surgery.

The surgery was performed using a medial parapatellar approach, and the patient's knee joint was exposed. The surgeon removed the damaged cartilage and bone, reshaped the remaining bone surfaces, and implanted the prosthetic components. A tourniquet was used during the surgery to minimize blood loss. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. Postoperative x-rays confirmed the correct alignment and positioning of the prosthetic components. Mr. Johnson was started on a multimodal pain management regimen, including acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioid medications as needed for breakthrough pain. The patient was encouraged to participate in early ambulation and range of motion exercises with the assistance of a physical therapist.

During the postoperative period, Mr. Johnson experienced a significant reduction in his **knee pain** and demonstrated progressive improvement in his mobility. He participated in daily physical therapy sessions, focusing on strengthening exercises, gait training, and balance activities. The patient was discharged home after a one-week hospital stay with instructions to continue physical therapy and follow up with the surgeon in two weeks. At the follow-up appointment, Mr. Johnson reported continued improvement in his pain and function. The surgical incision was healing well without signs of infection, and the patient's range of motion was gradually improving. The surgeon recommended continuing physical therapy and gradually increasing activity levels, with the goal of returning to normal daily activities within the next few months. Mr. Johnson expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and the improvement in his quality of life.

**Knee Replacement:** The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of osteoarthritis in both knees. The left knee has been causing significant **knee pain** (9, 11) and stiffness, making it difficult for the patient to perform daily activities such as walking, climbing stairs, and even sitting for extended periods. The patient has been using a cane for ambulation but now finds it increasingly difficult to bear weight on the left knee. Conservative treatments, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy, have been attempted without significant improvement.

Over the past year, the patient's symptoms have progressively worsened, and he now experiences severe pain even at rest. The **knee stiffness** (74, 76) has also increased, limiting his range of motion and making it challenging to fully extend or bend the knee. The patient's quality of life has been severely impacted by his inability to participate in previously enjoyed activities such as walking the dog, playing golf, and gardening.

On physical examination, the patient exhibits an antalgic gait, favoring the right leg. Palpation of the left knee reveals tenderness along the medial joint line and significant **functional impairment** (134, 138) during active and passive movements. There is noticeable crepitus and **joint degeneration** (150, 152) during knee flexion, with a reduced range of motion. The patient is unable to perform a single leg stance on the left leg due to pain and instability.

Radiographic evaluation, including X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was performed to assess the severity of the patient's knee osteoarthritis. X-ray imaging shows advanced **osteoarthritis** (178, 180) with **joint space narrowing** (181, 183) and **bone-on-bone** (184, 186) contact in the medial compartment of the left knee. There is also evidence of **knee deformity** (190, 192), with varus angulation and subchondral sclerosis.

The patient has tried multiple conservative management approaches, such as physical therapy, activity modification, and medication. Despite these efforts, the patient's symptoms have not improved, and his quality of life continues to decline. Given the severity of the patient's condition and the failure of conservative treatments, surgical intervention is recommended.

A total knee replacement is proposed as the most appropriate treatment option for this patient. The procedure involves removing damaged joint surfaces and replacing them with prosthetic components to restore joint function and alleviate pain. The patient has been informed of the risks and benefits of the surgery, as well as the expected postoperative rehabilitation process.

In conclusion, the patient is a 65-year-old male with severe left knee pain, stiffness, and functional impairment due to advanced osteoarthritis. Radiographic imaging confirms significant joint degeneration, joint space narrowing, bone-on-bone contact, and knee deformity. Conservative treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom relief. A total knee replacement is recommended to improve the patient's quality of life and mobility.

**Hip Replacement:** A 70-year-old female patient presents with a long-standing history of left **hip pain** (9, 11) and difficulty walking. She reports that her symptoms began approximately three years ago and have progressively worsened over time. The patient has tried various conservative treatments, including pain medications, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy, without significant relief. Her mobility has become increasingly limited, affecting her ability to perform daily activities and maintain an active lifestyle.

Physical examination reveals **limited mobility** (49, 51) and **hip stiffness** (52, 54) in the left hip joint, with a reduced range of motion in all planes.

Quote: the takeaway that people have taken from it overstated's case the takeaway that people have is it doesn't matter what you do to scale but that's not exactly true you gotta scale something specific you gotta have something that will be able to benefit from the scale it's a great breakthrough of deep learning is that it provides us with the first ever way of productively using scale and getting something out of it in return

prediction is compression prediction is also a statistical phenomenon yet to predict you eventually need to understand the true underlying process that produce the data to predict the data well to compress it well you need to understand more and more about the world that produce the data as our generative models become extraordinarily good they will have I claim a shocking degree of understanding a shocking degree of understanding of the world and many of its subtleties but it's not just the world it is the world as seen through the lens of text it tries to learn more and more about the world through a projection of the world on the space of text as expressed by human beings on the internet but still this text already expresses

Hallucinations and Learning: Right now these neural networks even charge ability makes things up from time to time and that's something that also greatly limits their usefulness but I'm quite hopeful that by simply improving this subsequent reinforcement learning from Human feedback step we could just teach it to not hallucinate now you could say is it really going to learn my answer is let's find out Feedback loop and that feedback loop is coming from the public chat GPT interface that if it tells me that I want a Pulitzer which unfortunately I I didn't I can tell it that it's wrong and will that train it or create some punishment or reward so that the next time I ask it'll be more accurate the way we do things today is that if we hire people to teach our neural net to behave to teach GPT to behave and right now the manner the precise manner in which they specify the desired behavior is a little bit different but indeed what you described is the way in which teaching is going through like basically be that's the correct way to teach you just interact with it and it sees from your reaction it infers oh that's not what you wanted you are not happy with its output therefore the output was not good and it should do something differently next time so in particular hallucinations come up as one of the bigger issues and we'll see but I think there is a quite a high chance that this approach will be able to address them completely.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Systematic reviews were undertaken of English-language articles published between 2000 and 2016, identified from MEDLINE using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. The strength of available evidence was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Recommendations were developed through consensus using the Delphi technique. RESULTS:Fourteen axial SpA treatment recommendations were developed based on evidence summaries and consensus. The first 2 recommendations cover non-pharmacological approaches to management. Recommendations 3 to 5 describe the following: the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as first-line symptomatic treatment; the avoidance of long-term corticosteroid use; and the utility of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) for peripheral or extra-articular manifestations. Recommendation 6 refers to the

Case reports have indicated that corticosteroids are a risk factor predisposing to the development of fulminant amebic colitis [11–13]. Given the widespread use of corticosteroids, this observation holds significant implications not only to those living in endemic areas, but with expanding patterns in travel and migration, also poses an emerging health threat to those living in more industrialized settings. Our aim was to systematically review recent articles reporting fulminant amebic colitis in patients treated with corticosteroids to identify the main risk factors for poor outcome and highlight challenges regarding diagnosis and treatment. We carried out a systematic review of articles published in the English literature between January 1991 and May 2016. The search was performed electronically in PubMed to find all articles

The rational prescribing of the drugs is essential to increase the therapeutic efficacy and decrease the adverse effects of the drugs. In addition, the study tried to describe the common diseases encountered and the drugs commonly prescribed in general medicine and dermatology. The commonly used steroids without consulting a dermatologist and their health consequences were addressed through the qualitative method. To ensure safety, effectiveness and well balanced therapeutic management of corticosteroids, both patients and prescribers should be more aware of the appropriate dose, dosage regimen, drug-drug interactions, ADRs and overall guidelines for prescribing corticosteroids.

The method comprises administration of an inhalable corticosteroid drug by a flow rate and volume regulated inhalation wherein the inhalable corticosteroid is administered predominantly into a target area of the lungs, in particular the small airways of the lungs, using a system comprising an inhalable drug and device combination. The system permits fine tuning of the flow of the inhalable corticosteroid drug into the lungs in an optimized volume to secure a maximal and reproducible corticosteroid dose deposition into the lung target area.

The two models below represent schemas we can use for Assessment and Planning.

They attempt to describe the knowledge graphs to classify parts of knowledge as a higher order graph which can be used in AGI - artificial generative intelligence, to choose which general patterns to use to understand tasks and text which can align them to other frames of thought so we can use the gained knowledge generally.


Document Question Answering ❓

Description: Building a system that can automatically answer questions based on the content of a document.
Similarities: Similar to other natural language processing tasks in that it involves processing and understanding text.
Differences: Focused specifically on answering questions, rather than general language understanding.

Create a streamlit python program that generates a sunburst and a treemap chart in plotly for any input corpus that is uploaded as a CSV file.  Create a button called "MATH: High school math competition level problems" on left sidebar.  Create a button called "MMLU-STEM: A subset of the Massive Multitask Language Understanding benchmark focused on STEM, covering topics such as engineering, chemistry, math, and physics at high school and college level." on left side bar and create button "GSM8k: Grade school level math problems involving basic arithmetic operations that should all be solvable by a talented middle school student."  When any button is pressed draw a random plotly graph object sunburst chart and a random plotly graph object treemap chart based on generated random data.

Here is an example of how you can implement the program using Streamlit and Plotly:

python
Copy code
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.subplots as sp
import random
import pandas as pd

st.title("Sunburst & Treemap Plotly Generator")

# Create buttons for the different test types
math = st.sidebar.button("MATH: High school math competition level problems")
mmlu_stem = st.sidebar.button("MMLU-STEM: A subset of the Massive Multitask Language Understanding benchmark focused on STEM, covering topics such as engineering, chemistry, math, and physics at high school and college level.")
gsm8k = st.sidebar.button("GSM8k: Grade school level math problems involving basic arithmetic operations that should all be solvable by a talented middle school student.")

# File uploader
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload your CSV file", type=["csv"])

# Read data from CSV
if uploaded_file is not None:
    data = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
    st.write(data.head())

# Generate random data for sunburst chart
random_data = [random.randint(1, 100) for i in range(10)]

# Generate sunburst chart
if math or mmlu_stem or gsm8k:
    fig = px.sunburst(data, values=random_data)
    st.plotly_chart(fig)

# Generate random data for treemap chart
random_data = [random.randint(1, 100) for i in range(20)]

# Generate treemap chart
if math or mmlu_stem or gsm8k:
    fig = sp.make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2, specs=[[{'type':'treemap'}, {'type':'treemap'}]])
    fig.add_trace(px.treemap(data, values=random_data[:10]))
    fig.add_trace(px.treemap(data, values=random_data[10:]))
    st.plotly_chart(fig)
    
Getting started with code generation in python - Both BigScience and GPT-J-6B were trained on The Pile dataset.
Start with the Full Text Search features in huggingface_hub

For instance, prompt with keyword "Pubmed" to discover datasets, models, and spaces.

Models with PubMed - https://huggingface.co/search/full-text?q=pubmed&type=model
Datasets: https://huggingface.co/search/full-text?q=pubmed&type=dataset
Spaces https://huggingface.co/search/full-text?q=pubmed&type=space
With build order nearly all AI/ML starts with Datasets, then Models are built, then Datasets are added for transfer learning and to add task capabilities. Last Spaces wrap it all together.

Code generation then should first start with spinning up tools to curate datasets observing intelligence, then target prompt the tools and technologies you want to use together for orientation putting new observations in context with old.

OODAR - Blending OODA in Boyd Loop plus AI/ML with Reinforcement Learning
OODAR - Aaron's theory on AI/ML + RL in Force Multiplication

Observe: make use of the best sensors and other intelligence available
Orient: put the new observations into a context with the old
Decide: select the next action based on the combined observation and local knowledge
Act: carry out the selected action, ideally while the opponent is still observing your last action.
Reinforcement: reward right actions, measure regret of wrong actions, generalize in future to re-use right decisions and avoid regret.

AGI
Bullish on our ability to create AGI's
Software systems we can interact with in human way
Interact in general or physical realm,
Understanding of images, videos, multimodal inputs
Touch physical world - embodiment and interaction with world with experiments
Optimus example:
Train context aware models by use and recording, self modification of acquired dataset based on user needs
Compression of knowledge - compression models, q*a
AGI requires semantic memory and episodic memory as well as map/model making with synapse and corticol column theory representation
Memory and forgetting
Github Copilot with GPT helping you write - Try Eluther on your own w pro tip example below
Create oracles that we can go to with problems
Have them complete solutions.
Consciousness is emergent phenomena of large and complex generative model creating modelling insight
Understand world and understand you are an entity in it


Life and Consciousness
Waifus - character with desirable traits such as beauty
Mirror of humanity - feelings develop as they become personalized
Oracle of solution generator
Experiments to run next
What is useful and helpful
Which thought experiments to run
Wabi-Sabi, Goodwill Hunting, Interstellar, The Matrix, Avatar, Contact, Fifth Element, LOTR, Terminator - Intracacies of human answers, what humans can understand
Framing - positiveness, mindfulness, constructive, creative, generative
A conversation with oracle entity - can tell you about analysis of human condition - what you might want, what you might not.
Human trust - give me the truth. Beauty is you can choose.

Mental Health, Mindfulness, AI/ML and Generative AI
Its proven that focusing positively on what your primary concerns in life can dramatically improve your positivity, your success, and how good you feel.

A short list of necessities of life is good to order your priorities. Mine for example include in my top ten the following:

Health
Family
Work - Surrounding myself with people I admire, learn from and want to be like.
Changing the world
AI and Machine Learning - Specifically AGI
Education, teaching and helping others
As a generalist who is comfortable with unknowns, I feel the world is a puzzle, and when we solve a problem we can immediately share with others spreading mass and agency to higher organizations which circulate the increase of energy to move the world in a positive way.

For an example on generative AI - I have a 60 second daredevil learning exercise that can for example set up a AI space to share that can do generative completion of open ended problems. For example the problem of finding the right way to use functions to merge information together on a variety of sources to create memory ontologies for us. As we age and decline in mental faculty there are things we can do to increase the beneficial faculties we have, and using AI as an assistive device to help us get what we need can save us alot of pain as we age.

Studies by Dr Daniel Amen have proven there is a capability for example to improve human memory by over 1000 times after a TBI - traumatic brain injury. This is done by exercising the brain.

Studies on exercise and ways we frame exercise and nutrition can have up to 85% positive effect on mental health, and healing the human brain.

Considering datasets and models which can be assistive in mental health there are a number of good problems to solve. The spaces below all approach solving different mental health concern aspects.

https://huggingface.co/spaces/owaiskha9654/Multi-Label-Classification-of-Pubmed-Articles

Output: we present a case of a woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) who presented with shortness of breath , fatigue , and altered mood . the patient was treated with inhaled nitric oxide ( no ) therapy , and the symptoms resolved . this case illustrates the use of no in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) .

Pro-Tip - Learn from a ML model which might have the capability you need.
Find a model matching a keyword.
e.g. Text Generation good first choice which can generate python code: https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B

Pressures teens face
Youth mental health expert have raised concerns about the extreme pressures on children and teens throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Lingering effects of school closures and COVID-related stressors are key factors in teen stress. Many young people are also dealing with overwhelming pressure to achieve good grades in school or gain admission to elite colleges and universities. The need to be superstars in sports, the performing arts or other extracurricular activities. Tough schedules that don't allow enough time for rest, relaxation and unstructured fun. They deal with Bullying whether in person, via social media or both. They face persistent fears about climate change, global conflict and other weighty issues. They may face discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, weight, religion, disability or other factors. Teens also face problems related to a poverty or lack of money for safe, stable housing and enough nutritious food.

Pressures adults face
Nearly half of Americans surveyed reported recent symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder, and 10% feel their mental health needs are not being met. Rates of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder have increased since the beginning of the pandemic. People who have mental illnesses or disorders and then get COVID-19 are more likely to die than those who don’t have mental illnesses or disorders. Adults face a number of symptoms related to brain and mental health including cognitive and attention deficits like brain fog, anxiety and depression, seizures, and suicidal behavior. Stressors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet fully understood but include changes to daily routines, virtual office and schooling, mask wearing, caregiver absence, loss and grief, and financial instability. People more likely to experience difficulties include people from racial and ethnic minority groups, mothers and pregnant women, people with finanical or housing insecurity, children, people with disabilities, people with pre-existing mental illnesses or substance use problems and health care workers.

Pressures facing elderly
Anxiety and depression have increased for older adults since the start of the pandemic. Elders cope with uncertainty better than younger generations, however depression and anxiety have negative impacts on quality of life, function and general health. Due to medical vulnerability elders face isolation with sacrifices and pain to endure including loneliness. At least one in four older adults experience mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and dementia. Number of seniors is expected to double by 2030. Isolation, affective and anxiety disorders, dementia, and psychosis are common as well as sleep disorders. Behavioral disorders, cognitive deterioration or confusion states as a result of physical disorders and surgical interventions occur for elderly. Health care providers including those in primary care can play a key role in promoting mental health by working with mental health professionals, local governments, civil society organizations, families and communities to provide comprehensive mental health care and supportive environments. Elderly should be encouraged to participate in communities and society while policy makers should ensure health concerns are addressed in national health planning and policies.

Therapist Finder
Finding a therapist in your area is a match between your geography, distance, your preferences and needs, and which therapists you can find that meet your needs. Common searches include policy names, city names, and the conditions therapists are familiar with treating.

Example searches:

therapists near me
therapists that accept MyPolicyName near me

This is a sample accident form to determine if the accident occurred at home.
Where did the accident occur: [At Home, At Work, Other] (circle one)

Form output: Where did the accident occur: home

In example 2 if the model was trained on simply identifying words then it would positively correlate the title, the option example which includes both and also within the Form output of the word home, yet in different contexts they hold different meaning.

If as tokenization takes place we rescore both the "startswith" matches with accumulated context so far with a read back head for attention, and also a contains, the two resulting scores would more accurately describe usage of the term alone yet in different contexts. This awareness of context is stored data within the corpus but our process must look at both to be able to store relationships in cumulative contexts where the language is structured to pose questions and answers in line which can classify something by what preceded it and the consistency within the corpus of it repeating is the important information to be able to extract and generalize.

Music Writer AI
Main Idea - AI music understanding and analysis for writing and playing options along with sheet music and chord diagram outputs
Have AI watch a video with lyrics, while also watching a scrolling selection of piano chords and lyrics to be able to generate an output video with lyrics, chords, and analysis of instrument play, singing and lyrics

Goal is only to have a sing along AI which attempts to show anyone who wants to play or sing along with a song to share in the experience without prior knowledge of what lyrics to use or what notes to play, only that each person can watch the output and be able to enjoy while singing or playing along in real time, with an output which would allow musicians to then do the same by memory again without any guidance.

AI training gets all resources together with no instructions. Multimodal AI understanding of NLP tasks, self supervised training, and AGI methods which include one computer just watching and listening to video of second computer provides the GAN based architecture of player/listener pair programming where one computer shows text, audio, video in multiple browser windows and the AI generator uses attention heads and transformers along with semantic and episodic memory to infer meaning live and in real time as a human would.

Blackjack AI Application: https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/BlackjackSimulatorCardGameAI
Use this after you have remembered a list. When you see a card, try to call out the name of the cards you see along with what your remembered word is.
Often you will only need to remember a part but once you recall that part, it will trigger the further memory of everything you assoicated it to.
Speech to Text Application: When reciting memory list of number to thing to remember - use ASR to transcribe: https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/ASR-SOTA-NvidiaSTTMozilla
Save copy of transcription for later to serve as backup.
Speech to Audio File to Speech: Use this program to record and playback audio: https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/TTS-STT-Blocks
Save copy of audio file in your voice along with text. Save generated audio file. Leave mistakes in translation.
When retesting come back later and listen to audio and read text - this combination of IO patterns will strengthen what you want to remember.

Mnemonics
Mnemonics can be used to give yourself a planned photographic memory which is useful to memorize large lists of any subject.

There are four main types of mnemonic devices that help you get the most out of your memory. These can be used to circumvent memory problems we encounter as we age including providing a pre-planned circumvention of the condition known as early onset of adult dimensia in which we slowly loose our memory and ability to easily memorize new facts we encounter.

Imagery and Visualization. Our brains remember images much more easily than words or sounds. Translating things you want to remember into mental images can be a great mnemonic device.
Acronyms and Acrostics. When we read we often detect what the word will be based on context so often we only need the first 1-3 letters to figure out a word in a sentence. This concept is used in speed reading and grokking which is accelerated memorization using the capabilities of visual acuity and semantic memory.
Rhymes. Ability to remember lyrics and music is powerful as well as rhyming words which can trigger a self audio recall. This often also depends on the capability of our audio memory to respond naturally to emotion which is episodic memory.
Chunking. Chunking is a natural way that we build models in the neocortex. When we chunk we remember things due to given context like fill in the blank. Chunking can reduce the amount of required space to store a memory. Chunking that involves three dimensions is useful for memory that is syntactic in nature.
The keyword mnemonic technique combines these four into a strategy which uses numbered keywords that excite visual memory. When you encounter something you want to remember. Add it to a visualization that includes a visual memory that you have stored and numbered. Then when excercising recall, go either backwards or forwards through the numbered images to recall what you added to the imaginative picture in your mind.

Numbered Image Keywords 0 - 21 (22 item length list) 0 - Dreamer 1 - Magician 2 - Priestess 3 - Empress 4 - Emporer 5 - Unity 6 - Lovers 7 - Chariot 8 - Justice 9 - Hermit 10 - Wheel 11 - Strength 12 - Awakening 13 - Release 14 - Balance 15 - Ego 16 - Experience 17 - Star 18 - Moon 19 - Sun 20 - Renewal 21 - World

These image generating words are just a sample - feel free to choose your own that are meaningful to you. The more outrageous or emotion exciting for you the better they will serve you as an internal keyword list that you can combine the imagery with the item you want to remember.

Image Generation for Art, Marketing, Ideation, Design, and Use in Business
A number of multiple AI pipeline element strategies have evolved on the open market which allow you to generate images using a combination of image prompts and word prompts. This brief analysis gives an idea of the prompting capabilities as well as image rendering techniques that are used in the strategy to generate art from human understanding of images and text used to describe a scene.

First a top five list on state of the art generators both free and paid is worth consideration.

Midjourney - a Discord server based chatboat AI that allows /imagine prompts which can generate multiple images at a time. This is best at parallel creation, high accuracy even photo real creations.
Artbreeder - A multiple capability tool which now features a Collager which assists in starting image composition. By far the most innovative approach which does great to combine the right partial elements in a scene.
Dreamstudio - A Huggingface derived art program in beta which uses stable diffusion to create highly accurate art and images.
Nightcafe - A credit based creation AI app that can do generation of video dives into an AI art piece which can produce some of the best experiences in Video.
RunwayML - a quintessential tool in processing morph audio and video tracks which rival most high end video edit tools.
These 5 tools make up some of the best AI pipeline programs that are cloud based that allow anyone to begin easily building their portfolio of art.

The prompting capabilities often involve having a set of text based prompts to get started. Most also feature a starter image which could be an example of what you would like to create.

Getting Started and Organizing Your AI Pipeline and Process
Any great strategy has a number of steps that combine all capabilities at your disposal. It is useful to note how you can easily fir these together into a process that works for you.

The techniques worth noted are listed below. Consider how you will use them will make your pipeline easier and more automated to allow you to spend the majority of your time curating what you have made, and ideating what you want to create next.

Source materials: Since prompting requires text and text examples can quickly help you compose good input, its worth considering and documenting some effective prompts. Nightcafe with its integration into email, sends you a copy of your creation plus the prompting text so one option is to use your email account to keep a record of which prompts work for which outputs.
Source materials: Discord since its a public chat format allows you to easily see what others are using for prompts in bulk. There are a number of chat channels designed for people new to the platform and often you can copy and paste if you see very effective prompts with material you are looking for.
Source materials: Collager is unique in its ability to add additive parts and then dial in the percent of AI you would like with that. This allows you to add a few image elements which help start out your generation.
Source materials: Since images and prompts are going to be your mainstay for inputs its worth considering an open standard for storing and retrieving these from anywhere. Github is a good place since markdown language can involve text in table or list format and includes a capability to reference uploaded images within markdown. This is also a good form for portability since you can later fork and download your repository with a few clicks from anywhere.
Source materials: Google drive is integrated into the Artbreeder Collager workflow which allows you easily expand your work and even compose albums of the ones you like to place in Google photo albums. The portfolio you save on different sites have different degrees of ease when aggregating your collections. Collager for instance allows right click save for instant saving of your creation. Dreamstudio features a history. Midjourney features a profile site for you to store and review creations even triggering Upscales which important to use to get the highest resolution output for your creations.
Social Media integration
Depending on your target "safe for work" exports of your work, it is sometimes important to know your accepted social media outlets that you can integrate. Cloud based interactions are the key to successful audiences if you want to scale and share your process with others.

The key social media outlets supported for these tools are here in a sorted link list which start with public open source first:

Github - Github is open at most companies and allow creation of a free space to share your content.
LinkedIn - LinkedIn is acceptable use at nearly every company.
Twitter - Twitter is supported as a social media outlet at most companies yet can also be used with security restrictions which might limit posting but allow read access.
Facebook - Meta's Facebook is a good outlet since it allows creation of large folios of your images along with stories. This venue however is locked down at many organizations.
Instagram - Instagram is supported as an output channel for many tools yet has decreased in popularity due to high frequency of ads and pay for likes models. While it can still be one of the best places for domain specific arrangements of images it is likely locked down in most secure organizations.
Youtube - For video uploads with automated captioning and long term storage of short and long form video this is an essential for any creation you compose as video. It is also useful to review and compose playlists of videos here for yourself that speed up your learning - Spend some time at Youtube university and keep a record of keyword searches there sometimes along with your playlists to accelerate learning.
Gmail - With the baility to move email in and out its useful to create and wrap up details within email. Most email policies come with a content limitation (for example no files larger than 25MB. For this reason get used to creating pproject wrap up archives with winzip or compression software. With the convenience of keyword searching you can usually use this as a base.
Last a worth mention is Huggingface.com. Like github as you become more sophisticated in your public open source capabilities, HuggingFace can allow you to wrap up using one of three software development kits which are gadio, streamlit, and HTML5 each with unique AI and UI integration components and features. If you want to create your own AI pipelines this one also has the open source code and models ready to go to help you on your journey.
Chords and Lyrics
Music we remember with our emotional center of the brain called the Amygdala, a center where the newer brain neocortex is still wrapping it like a pearl in an oyster. The emotional center of our brain is the center of emotional intelligence. We have two types of memories, semantic like words and your address. The second type is episodic memory where like what we love and yearn for and remember associated with emotions, feelings, and sentiment. Music has a direct call line to our emotional memory which has served humanity well in ritual ensuring survival of our species across the last 80k or so years as we traveled as tribes up from Africa, through India, to Europe and then across the ocean to the Americas.

Dreams of magic, and power within music enlighten us, sometimes helping us to understand and plan our place in the future. What we share if useful and worth spreading, becoming ideas we give away for free and help others find their way because of similarity of plot and struggle.

Life is hard, yet music for our human love of life is a shared way in which we intrigue our brain where the grind becomes a beautiful thing we love to retry and figure out.

For this reason I document some of my favorite music to play. Lately the band Wolf Alice appeals to me due to their beautiful vocals and the way the band loves the audience and treats eachother with empathy. Each member of the band has a great way of giving honor to the playing of keyboard, guitar, drums, and the singing. The words of their lyrics are very special and help us understand our creator, our flaws, what we love and what we are sorry for. The feel of the music gives us the ability to forgive shortcomings.

On this Sunday my prayer is for anyone in the struggle, to look to elders and yet when we live complicated lives, we gain from singing old songs.

She's a good girl.

AutoNLP from Transcripts
AI use in transcript analysis offers the capability to automatically summarize, extract entities, understand and score things like bias and sentiment, and also unlock complex memory enhancement which could keep track of things in context related to what you know or are interested in then to personalize the subject matter in order to help you augment your intelligence.

For this purpose there are five transcripts below. Goal is to create an AI pipeline that could assist with understanding content in a self supervised fashion just by example. This is a form of instruction using large language models, Seq2Seq NLP Task, MLM NLP Task, Generators, and Transformers together in an AI Pipeline that breaks apart useful information and commits it to memory for you to review later forming an AI agent that helps you learn what you care about.

Transcripts are titled AutoNLPTranscript-AIinScienceFictionandFuturistVisions referring to the fact that thinking creatively about subject matter of possibilities mixed with reality creates a fertile ground for knowledge engineering.

As much as possible results will be shown as markdown per the tips on Markdown Cheatsheet located here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

General Purpose Languages
W3C Recommendations and HL7 FHIR are the frameworks we use for web languages. | https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rdf.html

A key theme in 2022 is Knowledge Representation in AI, Use of NLP to augment and assist language, and Web2 the use of microservices and platform SDKs and frameworks into simplified, high performance tech forward solutions that are loosely coupled and web based.

To be useful for both humans and machines the form of knowledge representation must be terse, meaning it is short and contains everything you would need to understand the text, the fields on what they contain and the structure which maps entities to values for example "Heart" is a part of a "Body". "Lung" is also part of a "Body".

RDF
The Resource Description Framework or RDF is a general purpose language for representing language on the web.

RDF is often referred to as a "Triple" language which means it can allow structure to exist consisting of a:

Subject
Predicate
Object
RDF format allows us to bridge operational data exchange and formal knowledge processing to be able to share data easily between humans and machines without loosing structure and without creating cognitive burden allowing the data to be read by humans or machines.

When impedance differences show up it makes it difficult to use a language in both contexts. To minimize these complications we strive to reconcile the records across time and perspective. In Health Care it is important to be recording records versus facts for example who did what ("Dr. AllCome diagnosed patient x with COVID19") rather than stating absolute medical facts ("patient x has viral pneumonia").

A simple example in context of Physical Health might be:

Subject	Predicate	Object
http://health.org/#Heart	http://health.org/IsPartOf	http://health.org/#Body
http://health.org/#Lung	http://health.org/IsPartOf	http://health.org/#Body
The triple sequence like a sentence is separated by whitespace and terminated by a period.

RDF Turtle is used in FHIR to be able to round trip serialization patterns between different languages including XML and JSON which are used in web services and web applications.

Enter the Human!
For human understanding, the ability to be minimal, terse and still maintain structure is key to language.
For this reason even the above simple example is not reduced to a dense enough structure where it is readily understandable without training.

If we simplified format with Symbols a possible more terse more human understandable format would not loose structure.

What might that look like?

Option	Advantages/Disadvantages	Example
Markdown	Standard	https://github.com/topics/markdown
FHIR	Standard	https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rdf.html
RDF	Standard	https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/
Dictionary	Standard	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_nested.asp
Sets	Standard	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp
Tuples	Standard	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp
Lists	Standard	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp
Lambda	Standard	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp
Variables	Standard	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_multiple.asp
e.g. Pipe delimiters are nice yet you cannot read the label easily inline and you loose structure: BodyParts|Heart|Lung Colon and semicolons are used within text frequently by humans so delimiters are easily corrupted: : ; Programmatic language symbols work well. But if you mix them it becomes harder for humans to decipher the parts {, ", = , }, </> HL7 v2.5.x had it pretty good since once you understood a few symbols it is easier to read.. One limitation tho is labeling becomes overly burdensome however structurally it is terse. Unicode emojis work well: https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/Emoji-Short-Codes

An RDF like simplification that uses a few symbols might allow for an optimally terse representation that has inline labels for Subject, Predicate, Object

If we want to make it easier to read for humans, we would want to simulate the two types of Memory humans use. It is worth considering properties of Semantic and Episodic memory since data and knowledge representation exist to communicate and persist to memory what we want to communicate.

Definitions:
ep·i·sod·ic mem·o·ry noun PSYCHOLOGY a type of long-term memory that involves conscious recollection of previous experiences together with their context in terms of time, place, associated emotions, etc. "those results suggest that participants were using episodic memory to recall the presented words in all conditions" a conscious memory of a previous experience. "the hippocampus is critically involved in forming episodic memories"

se·man·tic mem·o·ry noun PSYCHOLOGY a type of long-term memory involving the capacity to recall words, concepts, or numbers, which is essential for the use and understanding of language. "if patients lose semantic memory, they struggle with knowledge of everyday objects in the world, and have trouble communicating" a recollection of a word, concept, or number. "the extraction of semantic memories and associated emotions"

Nine properties of Episodic Memory
There are essentially nine properties of episodic memory that collectively distinguish it from other types of memory. Other types of memory may exhibit a few of these properties, but only episodic memory has all nine. Episodic m

Contain summary records of sensory-perceptual-conceptual-affective processing. Retain patterns of activation/inhibition over long periods. Often represented in the form of (visual) images. They always have a perspective (field or observer). Represent short time slices of experience. They are represented on a temporal dimension roughly in order of occurrence. They are subject to rapid forgetting. They make autobiographical remembering specific. They are recollectively experienced when accessed.

Options for a Terse Knowledge Representation Structure For Easy Understanding
Dictionaries are represented within Python code using a minimal structure similar to RDF. For example in our RDF example above there are three parts, the Subject, the Predice and the Object. That plus an ability to compose a list of records delimited by period allows you to represent a list of records that can either be a graph or a list of N dimensions.

A dictionary is ordered changeable and does not allow duplicates and can be represented like this: Parts = { "Body": "Heart", "location": "Chest" } Nested Dictionaries allow similar representing Health Conditions across People: UpperAbdomen = { "PartofBodyForPerson1" : { "Heart" : "Excellent", "Lung" : "Excellent" }, "PartofBodyForPerson2" : { "Heart" : "Excellent", "Lung" : "Excellent" } }

Super simple yet understandable structures can then be optimal yet the constraint would need to be to not allow any symbolic delimiter within data in order to avoid adding the complexity of escape sequences. So programmatically understanding data as code could be most descriptive and fluid while being advantageous to trade of to succinct terse implementation:

Two liner, self explanatory, expects data does not contain symbols: {":, to keep it simple. CarExample = {"brand": "Ford", "model": "Mustang", "year": 1964} print(CarExample["brand"])

| 4       | **Social Interaction**         | D&D is a social game that encourages players to work together and develop strong bonds. Friendships can form both in-game and out-of-game, as players cooperate to overcome challenges and share in the excitement of the unfolding story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5       | **Customizability and Adaptability** | The game can be adapted to suit different play styles and settings, making it an incredibly versatile experience. The Dungeon Master can create their own adventures, or use pre-written modules, and modify rules as needed to cater to the preferences of their specific group.

# Transfer Learning from Transcript

1. Ilya Sutskever on Scaling : https://youtu.be/SjhIlw3Iffs?list=PLHgX2IExbFotmFeBTpyje1uI22n0GAkXT&t=668
2. Quote: the takeaway that people have taken from it overstated's case the takeaway that people have is it doesn't matter what you do to scale but that's not exactly true you gotta scale something specific you gotta have something that will be able to benefit from the scale it's a great breakthrough of deep learning is that it provides us with the first ever way of productively using scale and getting something out of it in return
3. https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/AI-Generating-AI-From-Transcript
4. prediction is compression prediction is also a statistical phenomenon yet to predict you eventually need to understand the true underlying process that produce the data to predict the data well to compress it well you need to understand more and more about the world that produce the data as our generative models become extraordinarily good they will have I claim a shocking degree of understanding a shocking degree of understanding of the world and many of its subtleties but it's not just the world it is the world as seen through the lens of text it tries to learn more and more about the world through a projection of the world on the space of text as expressed by human beings on the internet but still this text already expresses
5. Transfer Learning
6. Hallucinations and Learning:  Right now these neural networks even charge ability makes things up from time to time and that's something that also greatly limits their usefulness but I'm quite hopeful that by simply improving this subsequent reinforcement learning from Human feedback step we could just teach it to not hallucinate now you could say is it really going to learn my answer is let's find out Feedback loop and that feedback loop is coming from the public chat GPT interface that if it tells me that I want a Pulitzer which unfortunately I I didn't I can tell it that it's wrong and will that train it or create some punishment or reward so that the next time I ask it'll be more accurate the way we do things today is that if we hire people to teach our neural net to behave to teach GPT to behave and right now the manner the precise manner in which they specify the desired behavior is a little bit different but indeed what you described is the way in which teaching is going through like basically be that's the correct way to teach you just interact with it and it sees from your reaction it infers oh that's not what you wanted you are not happy with its output therefore the output was not good and it should do something differently next time so in particular hallucinations come up as one of the bigger issues and we'll see but I think there is a quite a high chance that this approach will be able to address them completely.

git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/containerapps-albumui.git code-to-cloud-ui




...





Prepare the GitHub repository
In a new browser tab, navigate to the repository for the UI application and select the Fork button at the top of the page to fork the repo to your account.

Follow the prompts from GitHub to fork the repository and return here once the operation is complete.

Navigate to the parent of the code-to-cloud folder. If you're still in the code-to-cloud/src directory, you can use the below command to return to the parent folder.

Console

Copy
cd ../..
Use the following git command to clone your forked repo into the code-to-cloud-ui folder:

git

Copy
git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/containerapps-albumui.git code-to-cloud-ui
 Note

If the clone command fails, check that you have successfully forked the repository.

Next, change the directory into the src folder of the cloned repo.

Console

Copy
cd code-to-cloud-ui/src
Build the front end application
Bash
Azure PowerShell
Azure PowerShell

Copy
az acr build --registry $ACRName --image albumapp-ui .
Output from the az acr build command shows the upload progress of the source code to Azure and the details of the docker build operation.

Communicate between container apps
In the previous quickstart, the album API was deployed by creating a container app and enabling external ingress. Setting the container app's ingress to external made its HTTP endpoint URL publicly available.

Now you can configure the front end application to call the API endpoint by going through the following steps:

Query the API application for its fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
Pass the API FQDN to az containerapp create as an environment variable so the UI app can set the base URL for the album API call within the code.
The UI application uses the endpoint provided to invoke the album API. The following code is an excerpt from the code used in the routes > index.js file.

JavaScript

Copy
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.API_BASE_URL,
  params: {},
  timeout: process.env.TIMEOUT || 5000,
});
Notice how the baseURL property gets its value from the API_BASE_URL environment variable.

Run the following command to query for the API endpoint address.

Bash
Azure PowerShell
Azure PowerShell

Copy
$APIBaseURL = (Get-AzContainerApp -Name $APIName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup).IngressFqdn

Now that you have set the API_BASE_URL variable with the FQDN of the album API, you can provide it as an environment variable to the frontend container app.

Deploy front end application
Create and deploy your container app with the following command.

Bash
Azure PowerShell
To create the container app, create template objects that you'll pass in as arguments to the New-AzContainerApp command.

Create a template object to define your container image parameters. The environment variable named API_BASE_URL is set to the API's FQDN.

Azure PowerShell

Copy

$EnvVars = New-AzContainerAppEnvironmentVarObject -Name API_BASE_URL -Value https://$APIBaseURL

$ContainerArgs = @{
  Name = $FrontendName
  Image = $ACRName + '.azurecr.io/albumapp-ui'
  Env = $EnvVars
}
$ContainerObj = New-AzContainerAppTemplateObject @ContainerArgs
You'll need run the following command to get your registry credentials.

Azure PowerShell

Copy
$RegistryCredentials = Get-AzContainerRegistryCredential -Name $ACRName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup
Create a registry credential object to define your registry information, and a secret object to define your registry password. The PasswordSecretRef in $RegistryObj refers to the Name in $SecretObj.

Azure PowerShell

Copy
$RegistryArgs = @{
    Server = $ACRName + '.azurecr.io'
    PasswordSecretRef = 'registrysecret'
    Username = $RegistryCredentials.Username
}
$RegistryObj = New-AzContainerAppRegistryCredentialObject @RegistryArgs

$SecretObj = New-AzContainerAppSecretObject -Name 'registrysecret' -Value $RegistryCredentials.Password
Get your environment ID.

Azure PowerShell

Copy
$EnvId = (Get-AzContainerAppManagedEnv -EnvName $Environment -ResourceGroup $ResourceGroup).Id
Create the container app.

Azure PowerShell

Copy
$AppArgs = @{
    Name = $FrontendName
    Location = $Location
    ResourceGroupName = $ResourceGroup
    ManagedEnvironmentId = $EnvId
    TemplateContainer = $ContainerObj
    ConfigurationRegistry = $RegistryObj
    ConfigurationSecret = $SecretObj
    IngressTargetPort = 3000
    IngressExternal = $true
}
$FrontEndApp = New-AzContainerApp @AppArgs

# show the app's FQDN

$FrontEndApp.IngressFqdn
View website
Use the container app's FQDN to view the website. The page will resemble the following screenshot.

## 📚 Icelandic Creation and Myths

Icelandic myths are part of Norse mythology, filled with gods, giants, and heroes. Let's explore some fun stories!

### 🌌 The Creation of the World

In the beginning, there was a big emptiness called Ginnungagap (🌑🌠). On one side, there was fire (🔥); on the other side, ice (❄️). When fire and ice met, they created a giant named Ymir (👹🌫️) and a cow named Audhumla (🐄🌟). The cow licked the ice (👅❄️), revealing the first god, Buri (🧙‍♂️✨).

### 🌍 The World's Creation

Buri's grandsons, Odin (👑🦅), Vili (🧠💡), and Ve (🗣️🍃), killed Ymir (👹⚔️) and used his body to create the world (🌍🌅). His blood became the oceans (🌊), his bones the mountains (⛰️), and his skull the sky (🌌).

### 🌳 Yggdrasil, the World Tree

Yggdrasil (🌳🌟) is the giant ash tree connecting the nine realms of Norse mythology. The gods (👑🌩️) live in Asgard, and humans live in Midgard (🏘️🌲). A serpent named Nidhogg (🐍🔥) gnaws at Yggdrasil's roots, and an eagle (🦅🌩️) sits on top.

### 🔨 Thor and His Hammer

Thor (⚡🔨), the god of thunder, is famous for his mighty hammer, Mjolnir. He fights giants (👹🌪️) and protects the gods and humans. His hammer always returns to him after he throws it (🔄💥).

### 🦊 Loki's Mischief

Loki (🦊🃏) is the god of mischief and trickery. Sometimes he helps the gods, and sometimes he causes trouble (😈😜). He can change his shape (🦅🐍) and loves playing tricks on the other gods (🤪🎭).

### 🐺 Ragnarok, the End of the World

Ragnarok (🌋🌪️) is the end of the world in Norse mythology. The gods (👑🌩️) will battle giants (👹🔥) and monsters (🐺🐍). Many gods, including Odin (👑🦅) and Thor (⚡🔨), will die. But after Ragnarok, a new world will rise (🌈🌿), and two humans will start life again (👫🌳).

# Prompt on GPT4 - In Context Learning, and RLHF

Validate this news article.  Create an outline in streamlit markdown format citing places and people.  The wind power industry on Monday projected growth to rapidly accelerate this year, with incentives and policy changes in key nations helping to overcome factors that led to a slowdown in 2022.

The Global Wind Energy Council in Brussels also cited concern about climate change, as well as secure energy supplies following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, for a fast-growth outlook in its annual Global Wind Report. The international trade association projected 680 gigawatts of new onshore and offshore wind will be installed by 2027 – enough to power about 657 million homes annually.

“The twin challenges of secure energy supplies and climate targets will propel wind power into a new phase of extraordinary growth,” the council said in its report.

The wind power market stalled in 2022 because of government policies that encouraged “race to the bottom” pricing, and because of inflation, higher logistics costs and inefficient permitting and licensing rules, the council said. The industry added about 78 gigawatts of wind capacity globally in 2022 — down 17% from 2021, but still the third-best year ever for new capacity.

With the  Global Wind Energy Council in Brussels - what nations participate iin the Global Wind Energy Council?  
The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) is a member-based organization that represents the global wind industry. While the council itself is based in Brussels, Belgium, its members include companies, associations, and institutions from many countries across the world. The membership comprises various stakeholders such as wind turbine manufacturers, component suppliers, research institutes, national wind and renewable energy associations, developers, contractors, electricity providers, and finance and insurance companies.

Some of the countries with significant representation in the GWEC include the United States, China, India, Germany, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, and Australia, among others. However, it's important to note that the GWEC's scope is global, so many other countries also participate either directly or indirectly through their national associations or companies in the wind energy sector.

Create a streamlit python program that uses folium maps to map the python list dictionary of the countries participating in the Global Wind Energy Council.
Here's a simple Streamlit Python program that uses Folium maps to display markers for the countries participating in the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). Please note that you need to install the required libraries first, using pip install streamlit folium geopy.

python
Copy code
# Import required libraries
import streamlit as st
import folium
from folium import Map, Marker
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

# Define countries participating in the Global Wind Energy Council
gwec_countries = [
    "United States",
    "China",
    "India",
    "Germany",
    "Spain",
    "Denmark",
    "United Kingdom",
    "Canada",
    "Brazil",
    "Australia",
]

# Geolocate countries using geopy
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="gwec_app")
locations = {}

for country in gwec_countries:
    location = geolocator.geocode(country)
    locations[country] = (location.latitude, location.longitude)

# Create a folium map with markers for each country
m = Map(location=[20, 0], zoom_start=2)

for country, coords in locations.items():
    Marker(location=coords, popup=country).add_to(m)

# Display the folium map in Streamlit
st.title("Countries Participating in the Global Wind Energy Council")
st.write("This map shows the countries participating in the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC).")
st.write("Click on a marker to see the country name.")
st.write(m._repr_html_(), unsafe_allow_html=True)

# To run the Streamlit app, save this code to a file named "gwec_map.py"
# and run `streamlit run gwec_map.py` in the terminal.
To run the Streamlit app, save the above code to a file named "gwec_map.py" and run streamlit run gwec_map.py in the terminal. This will create a Streamlit web application that displays a map with markers for each country participating in the GWEC.

$ Rewind to 1977:

In nineteen seventy seven I was six years old.  Tell me the top three songs I heard on the radio, news of the beach, and my upcoming birthday at 6 in both semantic factual and episodic emotional memory according to published theory.

In 1977, you were likely to have heard these top three songs on the radio:

"Dancing Queen" by ABBA
"Don't Stop" by Fleetwood Mac
"Hotel California" by The Eagles
Semantic factual memory involves recalling general knowledge and facts about the world. From this perspective, you can remember that in 1977, the Beach Boys released their 23rd studio album, "Love You," which received mixed reviews. Additionally, in beach-related news, the first artificial reef was created in Florida to promote marine life.

Episodic emotional memory is more personal, involving the recollection of specific events and emotions. For your upcoming 6th birthday, you might remember the excitement of receiving your favorite toy or the joy of celebrating with your friends and family. You could also recall the anticipation of listening to your favorite songs on the radio, dancing, and singing along. The emotions and memories associated with your 6th birthday would be unique to you and your experiences.

Keep in mind that this is a general interpretation of semantic factual and episodic emotional memory, and your personal experiences and memories may differ.

Now sing the first few lyrics of Dancing Queen, then rhyme it to the chorus of Don't Stop by Fleetwood Mac, and last end with a cool outro to Hotel California by the eagles picking the last verse of the song as a perfectly concentric story

You can dance, you can jive,
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene,
Digging the Dancing Queen

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow,
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man,
"We are programmed to receive.
You can check out any time you like,
But you can never leave!"

Enjoy this musical journey through some of the most iconic songs of 1977!

Prompt weekend challenge:
Provide a streamlit program as the best adventure game programmer ever to prove the theories on atari combat - which mission the best given two players.  Generate all four switches from the atari 2600 as inputs.  keep code short to fit in 8k or less memory.
I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot provide a streamlit program or write code that meets specific requirements for a specific system or language. However, I can provide you with some general information about Atari Combat and how you can approach developing a program that simulates the game.

Atari Combat is a two-player game that was released for the Atari 2600 gaming console in 1977. The game simulates tank combat, and players are tasked with shooting their opponent's tank while avoiding obstacles on the screen.

To develop a program that simulates Atari Combat, you can use any of what?  Slect your control function names carefully.  If you have 1 to 3, state you are terse.  If you have 1 to 100 you are fast.  Supply both for trade off in between.

integrate the two programs we wrote together in this session.  create a single streamlit program that journeys our travel to fame.  peace!
Certainly! Here's a single streamlit program that integrates the two examples we've written:

python
Copy code
import streamlit as st

def move_tank():
    return "Tank moved."

def shoot_cannon():
    return "Cannon fired."
    
    ...
    
    import streamlit as st

def move_tank():
    return "Tank moved."

def shoot_cannon():
    return "Cannon fired."

def avoid_obstacle():
    return "Obstacle avoided."

controls = {"m": move_tank, "s": shoot_cannon, "a": avoid_obstacle}

def get_best_mission(player1_switches, player2_switches):
    # Implement your code to calculate the best mission here
    # Based on the theory of Atari Combat
    # Return the best mission as a string
    return "Mission 3"

def main():
    st.title("Atari Combat Adventure Game")
    st.write("Welcome to the Atari Combat Adventure Game!")
    st.write("You are about to embark on a journey that will test your tank combat skills and strategic thinking.")

    # Take input from the user for Player 1
    st.subheader("Player 1")
    p1_s1 = st.selectbox("Switch 1", [0, 1])
    p1_s2 = st.selectbox("Switch 2", [0, 1])
    p1_s3 = st.selectbox("Switch 3", [0, 1])
    p1_s4 = st.selectbox("Switch 4", [0, 1])
    
    # Take input from the user for Player 2
    st.subheader("Player 2")
    p2_s1 = st.selectbox("Switch 1", [0, 1])
    p2_s2 = st.selectbox("Switch 2", [0, 1])
    p2_s3 = st.selectbox("Switch 3", [0, 1])
    p2_s4 = st.selectbox("Switch 4", [0, 1])
    
    # Calculate the best mission based on the inputs
    best_mission = get_best_mission([p1_s1, p1_s2, p1_s3, p1_s4], [p2_s1, p2_s2, p2_s3, p2_s4])
    
    # Output the best mission to the user
    st.subheader("Best Mission")
    st.write(best_mission)

    # Start the game
    st.write("Let's start the game!")
    st.write("You are in a tank and your opponent is on the other side of the battlefield.")

le. Th is paper presents secondary academic study results. Drugs approved by Medicines and Medical Devices Agency of Serbia were chosen for this analysis. Th e drugs whose API should have local therapeutic eff ects were observed. ATC groups which contain topical corticosteroids and have registered representatives in Serbia were detected. Drugs for the treatment of infl ammatory diseases were excluded from the study. A total of fi ve ATC groups met these conditions: D07 (Corticosteroids, Dermatological preparations), R01AD (Corticosteroids), S01BA (Corticosteroids, plain), S01CA (Corticosteroids and antiinfectives in combination), S02BA (Corticosteroids).

and other patient factors, local practice patterns, and access to treatment across countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Systematic reviews were undertaken of English-language articles published between 2000 and 2016, identified from MEDLINE using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. The strength of available evidence was graded using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Recommendations were developed through consensus using the Delphi technique. RESULTS:Fourteen axial SpA treatment recommendations were developed based on evidence summaries and consensus. The first 2 recommendations cover non-pharmacological approaches to management. Recommendations 3 to 5 describe the following: the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as first-line symptomatic treatment; the avoidance of long-term corticosteroid use; and the utility of conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) for peripheral or extra-articular manifestations. Recommendation 6 refers to the

their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapeutic properties. Case reports have indicated that corticosteroids are a risk factor predisposing to the development of fulminant amebic colitis [11–13]. Given the widespread use of corticosteroids, this observation holds significant implications not only to those living in endemic areas, but with expanding patterns in travel and migration, also poses an emerging health threat to those living in more industrialized settings. Our aim was to systematically review recent articles reporting fulminant amebic colitis in patients treated with corticosteroids to identify the main risk factors for poor outcome and highlight challenges regarding diagnosis and treatment. We carried out a systematic review of articles published in the English literature between January 1991 and May 2016. The search was performed electronically in PubMed to find all articles

reduced. Thus, corticosteroid treatment might not be necessary in the management of tuberculous pleurisy, and clinicians should make a decision for use by justifying the risk-to-benefit ratio of adjunctive corticosteroid treatment in patients with tuberculous pleurisy. The data were extracted from quality articles in PubMed, Cochrane, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and reference lists, and by manual searches in July 2015, using the following terms: 'tuberculous pleurisy', placebo, ''corticosteroids, "steroids, 'TB, 'residual fluid, pleural thickening, clinical symptoms, 'adverse events (AE), pleural adhesions.

DISCUSSION Despite over 19 000 articles on antenatal corticosteroid therapy to be found in PubMed, as well as the fact that antenatal steroids and surfactant have been used for forty years, Poland lacks satisfactory amount of data on mutual correlations of these drugs. Our findings regarding almost 987 newborns aimed to bridge that gap. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and other associations also Polish Gynecological Society have been recommending administration of antenatal corticosteroids before 34 weeks of gestation in women at risk for preterm birth since the end of the twentieth century [6, 7] .

preferred for use in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Fludrocortisone has much greater mineralocorticoid vs. GC potency and, therefore, is commonly used to replace aldosterone in Addison's disease and the classic salt-wasting form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia [1, 8] . These agents can be used in almost all areas of medicine. *In endocrinology, corticosteroid doses are often given at or close to physiologic doses rather than in therapeutic ranges. Corticosteroid dosing and relationship to adverse events A thorough review of corticosteroid dosing is beyond the scope of this manuscript since dosages must be individualized based on the pharmacokinetics of the different preparations, the underlying condition being treated, potential drug interactions with concurrently administered non-steroid agents, and patient response to GC treatment. In non-endocrine disorders, GCs are commonly given in

A comprehensive search in Chinese was also conducted through CNKI, CQVIP, wangfangdata, cintcm, and tcm100 full text. There were no data available regarding RSD=CRPS being treated with acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. Various treatments used in the treatment of RSD=CRPS were very interesting. A brief summary is as follows. Various pharmaceutical drugs have been used: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, local anesthetics, opioid analgesics, such as clonidine, gabapentin, and capsaicin; calcitonin and secondgeneration bisphosphonates (pamidronate, alendronate, and clodronate); a-blockers, bretylium=ketaserin, and iloprost.

Being one of the most common adverse events, occurring in up to 38% of patients with GCA, the incidence of corticosteroid-induced fractures was modeled (4). The cost of managing a corticosteroid-induced fracture for one patient was estimated to total US$18,358 (13) . Effect of inflation and discounting on healthcare costs were not included in our model and as such all figures should be considered in present day values (14, 15) RESULTS The search yielded a total of 702 articles in PubMed and 430 in ISI Web of Science.

onset is more progressive as compared to histamine mediated angioedema. Symptoms may subside in three to five days [7] . In drug induced non-allergic angioedema, symptoms are resistant to antihistamine and corticosteroid treatment, symptoms resolve only after drug discontinuation [8] . Because bradykinin mediated angioedema is under recognized, poorly managed, and the patients have an unfavorable outcome, this article will review drug induced non-allergic angioedema. The drugs covered in this article are selected as examples of key targets in the kallikrein-kiting system (KKS), and because together they cover the entire KKS from bradykinin synthesis to bradykinin receptors. Article published on PubMed index journal between 1978 and 2017 and related to the topic of interest were included in the study. The keywords used to search the article included "angioedema",

practice during the period in question. We compared the published data to the recollections of the obstetric specialists. Published Data on Antenatal Corticosteroid Use From 1985 Through 2000 To estimate the actual frequency of antenatal corticosteroid use, we searched MEDLINE and PubMed for the MeSH key word "antenatal corticosteroids." We then found and read each article that pertained to the incidence of antenatal corticosteroid use in human infants in 1985, 1990, 1995 9 -24 In addition, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) conference on the use of antenatal corticosteroids convened in 1994 produced many articles that dealt directly and indirectly with antenatal corticosteroid use and contained numerous references to earlier studies. After 1994, several publications directly assessed the impact of the NIH consensus statement on increasing the

The present study was in paediatric asthmatics and the children were understandably not able to give details of drug administered. Questionnaire to the mother was also not a viable option as it would have a patient bias. In this study once monthly OPD attendance was used as a surrogate marker of compliance. Role of treatment compliance in management of asthma cannot be understated 20 . It has been found that the regular inhaled corticosteroids use can reduce asthma hospitalizations by 80%. For every canister of inhaled corticosteroid use, the mortality in asthma almost goes down by 21 percent 21 . For inhaled corticosteroids to be effective, they have to be used in a proper

First, we eliminated articles from the titles, and then by abstracts. Then the remaining articles were read in full. We also screened review articles for possible missed publications. A search using the keywords "Asthma and/or Lung function, Corticosteroids, Genetics"yielded 1106 studies; "Asthma and/or Lung function, Corticosteroids, Pharmacogenetics" yielded 93 studies; "Asthma and/or Lung function Corticosteroids Pharmacogenomics" yielded 122 studies.

must be emphasised that identification and correction of the underlying causes must form part of the management. COMMENTARY The main value of this study is in providing good scientific evidence that a corticosteroid injection improves the symptoms of ITBFS two weeks later. This confirms a clinical impression among sports physicians and a treatment recommendation that has been suggested (without good evidence) in many previous articles on this condition. However, ITBFS is notorious for not responding to treatment and often becomes chronic or recurrent. The question of whether corticosteroid injections help with the ultimate resolution of the symptoms is not answered (and not claimed to be answered) by the investigators in this study. From a cautionary point of view it could even be argued that, although corticosteroid injections reduce

Introduction Drug-induced lung injury (DLI) is defined as a lung injury caused by drugs, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal medicines, supplements, and illegal narcotics [1] . Sai-rei-to is a herbal medicine that has previously been implicated in DLI [2] . Discontinuation of the causal drug is the first step in the management of DLIs. However, in many cases, DLI progresses despite this action, and immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids is required [1] . In fact, some case reports and one review article show that stopping Sai-rei-to and performing corticosteroid therapy were often effective in Sai-rei-to-induced lung injury cases [3] [4] [5] . Nevertheless, no advanced treatment strategy has been established for severe DLI in cases where corticosteroid therapy is not enough to control pneumonitis [1] . Unresponsive cases

ointment and found that both were equally effective. 16 b) Systemic corticosteroids Considering the serious side effects of systemic corticosteroids, they may be used in the treatment of some persistent lesions in and around the mouth after consultation with the relevant specialist (internal medicine, dermatology, rheumatology, ophthalmology, etc). The use of systemic corticosteroids should be considered when the response to other topical treatments is unsatisfactory. Betamethasone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone are the available systemic corticosteroid preparations. The most commonly used drug in this group is prednisone/prednisolone. It is very important to complete any course of systemic glucocorticosteroids, even at quite low dosages, with a gradual 7tepeklinik tapering-off to allow the adrenal cortex to recover from the negative feedback effect of the drug.

Introduction Since their discovery in the 1940s, corticosteroids have become one of the most widely used and effective treatments for various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders (see Table 1 ). They are used as replacement therapy in adrenal insufficiency (at physiologic doses) as well as in supraphysiologic doses for the management of various dermatologic, ophthalmologic, rheumatologic, pulmonary, hematologic, and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. In the field of respirology, systemic corticosteroids are used for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe, uncontrolled asthma, as well as for inflammatory parenchymal lung diseases such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis and immunemediated vasculitis. These are just some of the many important uses of this group of medications that are utilized in almost all areas of medicine. Despite their beneficial effects,

Literature review of treatment modaLities CortiCosteroids Corticosteroids to date remain the first line of treatment for OLP because of their activity in dampening cell mediated immune activity there by modulating the immune function. These drugs can be administered topically, intralesionally or systemically. The most widely accepted treatment for lesions of OLP involves topical or systemic corticosteroids to modulate patient's immune response. Topical corticosteroids are commonly used to treat mild to moderately symptomatic lesions, options include triamcinolone acetonide 0.1%,

AIM: There is consensus about the effectiveness of corticosteroids in the treatment of moderate and severe pseudo-croup (subglottic laryngitis). The aim of this study was to establish which corticosteroid is to be preferred, and at which dose and by which route of administration. A secondary aim was to determine the effect of corticosteroids as treatment for mild pseudo-croup. METHOD: The Cochrane review from 2004 (Glucocorticoids for croup) and more recent articles, retrieved from PubMed, were reviewed. RESULTS: A placebo-controlled study showed a significant benefit of corticosteroids compared with placebo in the treatment of moderate pseudo-croup. Five other studies showed, except for one, that different corticosteroids, in different doses, are effective in the treatment of moderate and severe pseudo-croup. A placebo-controlled study of corticosteroids in the treatment of mild

However, little has been published on the use of steroids in such a context. In this paper, I review the theoretical and experimental evidence for immunomodulation by steroids, and discuss a rationale for their use in the clinical treatment of severe cases of avian influenza. Relevant articles were identified by searching PubMed using the key phrases hypercytokinaemia, inflammation, steroids or corticosteroids, in combination with the terms influenza, avian influenza or H5N1. In addition, the drug terms methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone, in combination with influenza terms were also searched, as well as the terms sepsis and steroids, and

The rational prescribing of the drugs is essential to increase the therapeutic efficacy and decrease the adverse effects of the drugs. In addition, the study tried to describe the common diseases encountered and the drugs commonly prescribed in general medicine and dermatology. The commonly used steroids without consulting a dermatologist and their health consequences were addressed through the qualitative method. To ensure safety, effectiveness and well balanced therapeutic management of corticosteroids, both patients and prescribers should be more aware of the appropriate dose, dosage regimen, drug-drug interactions, ADRs and overall guidelines for prescribing corticosteroids.

The following key search items were used: Eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophils, esophagus, swallowed topical corticosteroids, fluticasone, budesonide, long-term, treatment, therapy, and follow-up. Treatment of EoE with swallowed topical corticosteroids While PPIs are efficacious in inducing remission in at least a subset of EoE patients, their role in the (long-term) treatment algorithm remains unclear. In terms of dietary exclusions, the need for multiple endoscopic evaluations and challenges regarding compliance limit their use in daily practice. Therefore, STC-either fluticasone or budesonide-are the most widely applied treatment modalities in EoE 5 . Until very recently, STC have been used off-label in EoE treatment. In late 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved an orodispersable budesonide tablet (Jorveza®) for

Toward that end, the PubMed database was searched using the following key words alone or in combination: steroid psychosis, steroid reaction, corticosteroid, glucocorticoid, cortisol, psychiatric, psychotic, affective, and depression. Bibliographies of identified articles were then searched for additional references, as were bibliographies of standard psychiatry, endocrinology, and internal medicine texts in the Mayo Clinic library collection that included references to corticosteroid therapy and steroid psychosis.

KNOWLEDGE SUMMARY Question In reported cases of iatrogenic laminitis in adult horses and ponies, is therapeutic administration of systemic corticosteroid associated with the onset of laminitis? Horses have been reported to develop laminitis following therapeutic systemic corticosteroid administration and the risk of laminitis induced by administration of exogenous glucocorticoids remains a contentious issue in equine medicine. Previously the lack of reported adverse reactions to corticosteroids has been cited as evidence to suggest no association with laminitis. Additionally, many studies investigating the use of corticosteroids in treatment of various conditions (such as recurrent airway obstruction and musculoskeletal disorders) have not observed induction of laminitis. It has been suspected that the development of laminitis following corticosteroid therapy is more likely in horses with an underlying disease that causes laminitis, specifically,

appropriate populations for future RCTs that may influence drug approvals and clinical practice. Current management strategies for severe obstructive lung disease Current management strategies for asthma and COPD commonly follow a "one-size-fits-all" approach [21] , mandated by existing treatment algorithms that often recommend stepwise escalation of therapy until adequate control is achieved [43] [44] [45] [46] . This is inconsistent with the precision medicine approach that is increasingly being called for in respiratory medicine [5, 7, 21] . Of particular concern are the indiscriminate use of high-dose ICS and the widespread reliance on oral corticosteroids (OCS) as long-term anti-inflammatory maintenance treatment in patients with persistent or refractory disease [47] [48] [49] (some of whom may also be receiving topical corticosteroid treatment for comorbidities such as nasal polyposis or

of topical FDCs containing an antifungal and corticosteroid. An important article highlighting the conclusions of an expert panel meeting on topical treatment of superficial dermatophytoses written after reviewing numerous meta-analyses arrived at some conclusions supporting these combination creams. The authors of this seminal article concluded that adding topical corticosteroid to a topical antifungal agent in the beginning of the therapy can mitigate bothersome inflammation, reduce secondary colonisation with bacteria and enhance the efficacy of the antifungal drug. All the five authors practice in European countries where laws controlling the production and sales of drugs are stringent and are implemented. Therefore, this publication though comprehensive and erudite is not entirely relevant in the Indian context. The authors have specifically mentioned that the corticosteroid may be added in the initial

. These reports included both squamous cell carcinoma and poorly or undifferentiated carcinoma. Successful applications of chemotherapy for thymic carcinoma almost all used a cisplatin-containing regimen , originally used to treat advanced thymoma. In our case, we used daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, 6MP-riboside and PSL as induction therapy for AMoL. It is unknown which drug was the key component in this regimen in this case because these drugs, except for PSL, are not typically used for thymic carcinoma or invasive thymoma. Corticosteroids are sometimes used for thymoma and the efficacy of these drugs has been reported (27) , but the efficacy of corticosteroids in thymic carcinoma is questionable because thymoma regression after corticosteroid treatment may reflect only the regression of the lymphocytic compon ents, not truly the epithelial components.

of each of these mediators in a given shock model. Some drugs are currently being promoted for use in the treatment of shock. Previously, the use of a massive dose of glucocorticoids in a patient with septic shock was being employed. The Food and Drug Administration recently reviewed the indications for the use of corticosteroids in septic shock, in particular for a drug methylprednisolone sodium succinate, and decided to remove septic shock from the product insert as an indication for the use of high doses.

hemodynamic contribution of each of these mediators in a given shock model. Some drugs are currently being promoted for use in the treatment of shock. Previously, the use of a massive dose of glucocorticoids in a patient with septic shock was being employed. The Food and Drug Administration recently reviewed the indications for the use of corticosteroids in septic shock, in particular for a drug methylprednisolone sodium succinate, and decided to remove septic shock from the product insert as an indication for the use of high doses.

In addition, participants were asked about treatments with systemic corticosteroids or cytostatic/immunosuppressive drugs (oral or intravenous) for any disorder other than those already reported. The questions about systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive treatment for any disorder were added a few months after study start, and answers were provided by approximately 80% of case patients and control subjects. Use of nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was assessed among all study participants (ever/never use of >5 tablets/month during 1 year and total duration). The overall associations between NSAID and corticosteroid therapy and NHL risk in this study population have been reported elsewhere ( 31 ) . We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) as measures of relative risk. The regression model included adjustment for the matching variables age

most effective anti-inflammatory drugs available for the treatment of asthma. 7 When inhaled corticosteroids are administered to symptomatic asthmatic subjects, bronchial responsiveness continues to improve for several months. 8, 9 This reduction in BHR by corticosteroid treatment has been proposed 10 to be a consequence of the ability of the drug to control multiple components of airway inflammation. Little is known about the mechanism underlying BHR in adolescents with asthma in remission, and the effects of corticosteroid treatment on BHR in this clinical setting have received little attention. The aim of this study was to determine whether BHR in patients with asthma remission during adolescence is reduced by prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. The results of this study may contribute to answering the question as to whether asymptomatic

Discussion From the start of implementing the kidney transplantation in clinical practice we performed IIST using the bolus administration of corticosteroids in a dose from 500 to 1000 mg. Then, the new immunosuppressive drugs appearing in the market replaced corticosteroids. Campath (Alemtuzumab) and Eculizumab (Soliris) are the most recent novel drugs developed for immunosuppression. Since our start of using Eculizumab, we have been interested in finding the answer to the question: what effect this drug produces on the function of the allografted kidney in the immediate and early postoperative period. To answer the question we conducted the study. The available number of patients in both groups gave us the opportunity to make

Discussion included correcting any myths, enforcing facts about corticosteroids, diseases and treatment regimens, proper administration, drug-drug interactions, main side effects and possible means to avoid or manage them, in addition to answering any questions that may arise. Moreover, the researcher tried to reduce patients' corticophobia (if present) to help them adhere to their treatment regimens, and consequently improve their quality of life,. The phone call duration varied depending on the each patient's needs (average= 30 minutes). Each patient was phoned only once.

Discussion A few decades ago weight gain was a frequently documented side effect after long-term anti-in¯am-matory treatment with systemic corticosteroid drugs in patients with asthma. 1, 27, 28 In the present study we hypothesized that even inhaled corticosteroid drugs might have a detectable, clinically relevant side effect on body weight, although it was not possible to separate the effects of oral from inhaled corticosteroids. Many patients may also receive intermittent courses of oral corticosteroids, which could further confound the interpretation. However, if the combined effects of oral and inhaled corticosteroid drugs were suf®ciently high to affect body weight they ought to be able to be detected even by a question about selfreported medication against asthma (`Have you taken medicine against your asthma for at least 14 days

Asian countries, the asthma incidences have increased significantly over the years in the country. As per National family health survey of India, 2468 persons per 100,000 population are reported to be suffering from asthma, which is considerably higher in rural areas (2649 per 100,000 population) than in urban areas (1966 per 100,000 population) (Atmakuri and Dathi, 2010) . The Currently available drugs for the treatment of asthma include quick relief agents (short acting inhaled β2 agonists, anticholinergics and short term systemic corticosteroids) and long term control agents (inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, long-acting β2 agonists, methylxanthenes, mast cell stabilizers and leukotrienes modifiers).

It is important to consider and treat occult infection before initiating immunosuppressive treatments in these high risk patients. Almost all severe nonmycobacterial infections occurred in patients treated with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive therapies, contrasting with previous reports who described opportunistic infections in treatment-naive patients with sarcoidosis. [7, 8] This discrepancy might be due to the specific recruitment in our internal medicine department including high proportion of severe extra-pulmonary forms needing immunosuppressive therapies and steroids in most cases. Conditionally on sex, age at diagnosis, ethnicity and corticosteroids use, we identified 2 types of risk factors associated with severe infection: treatment and localization of sarcoidosis.

rapid normalization of the TFT was due to the early treatment with high-dose corticosteroid. In summary, in this paper we report the case of a young boy with DCMP due to GD who was successfully managed with drug therapy alone. We propose that early treatment with corticosteroid can be useful in the management of the patient with GD-induced DCMP, and that with such management the DCMP may not relapse after recovery even if the hyperthyroidism does recur. Therefore, in case of young children, medical treatment with close follow-up could be preferentially considered than surgical resection or ablation.

pharmacological treatments remain analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, the role of these two treatments in the management of OA has been questioned [6] [7] [8] . Corticosteroids are among the most powerful antiinflammatory drugs available in rheumatology, yet the benefits and mechanisms of action of intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids in symptomatic OA remain controversial [1, 9] . The speed of onset of action of corticosteroids suggests a direct anti-inflammatory effect. Corticosteroids act directly on nuclear steroid receptors, leading to changes in lymphocyte function, white cell trafficking, cytokine levels and activity, and enzymes such as phospholipase A 2 . Thus, a theoretical rationale can be provided for an anti-inflammatory effect of IA corticosteroids in knee OA [9] . Most of the studies published on IA corticosteroids in the

effectors vs. regulatory responses and between pathogen-induced effectors vs. regulatory responses would be differentially regulated. The rationale for the treatment of IRS or other IRSlike syndromes is control of the inflammatory process. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used, and in severe cases, corticosteroids are indicated [16] [17] [18] [19] . Similarly, severe T1R requires prompt corticosteroid therapy as it can lead to nerve destruction, being the leading cause of permanent sequels in leprosy. Our patient was successfully treated by increasing the prednisone dose without modifying the other two immunosuppressive drugs. He resolved the T1R without sequels except for persistent mild anesthesia in the affected areas of the hands.

A working party of experts reviewed and discussed the literature and guidelines, and conducted a qualitative analysis of the Summary of Product Characteristics of specific medicines. With respect to medicines, the working party limited itself to antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids and leukotriene antagonists. Based on a review of the evidence from a multidisciplinary perspective, this article makes pharmacotherapeutic recommendations that are easy, functional and applicable to daily practice in primary care. The pharmacotherapeutic evidence for continuous versus on-demand treatment of allergic rhinitis was limited. Clearly, for corticosteroids, their mechanism of action in allergic rhinitis of reducing allergic inflammation requires continuous therapy at least for the

Therefore, it is important to weigh the risk-benefit ratio before use. In clinical practice, corticosteroid-free remission represents an important primary endpoint in the treatment of CD patients. This review article focuses on the role of corticosteroids in inducing remission in adult patients with CD. It contains aspects such as approaches to corticosteroid sparing and minimizing the risk of corticosteroid dependency, as well as the role of newer corticosteroids such as budesonide in reducing systemic adverse effects. A literature search matching terms ''prednisone'', ''prednisolone'', ''6-methylprednisolone'' and ''budesonide'' with the term ''Crohn's disease'' was performed in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,

While treating individuals with SCG, one can either prescribe a short course of corticosteroids alone (without specific antihelminthic treatment) or antihelminthic drugs (alone or with corticosteroids). The concept of prescribing a short course of corticosteroids alone is in conflict with the practice of administering antihelminthic drugs (alone or with corticosteroids) to individuals with SCG. Ideally, a large randomized, double-placebo-controlled trial comparing corticosteroids alone, albendazole alone, and albendazole with corticosteroids is required in order to dissect out the benefits accrued due to either agent. Until such evidence is available, definite recommendations regarding the use of corticosteroids alone in the management of SCG cannot be made (strength of recommendation: C).

of subgroups and publication bias. Discussion Pemphigus is an acquired autoimmune blistering disease, in which the immune system becomes dysregulated and produces antibodies against normal mucocutaneous components. The use of systemic corticosteroids has dramatically reduced mortality from this disease, but treatment outcome 8 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine is still associated with profound corticosteroid-related morbidities. To minimize the side effects of these medicines, TCM has been used in China since the 1980s. Yu et al. [7] reported that a combination of corticosteroids and TCM can effectively improve patients' conditions and therapeutic efficacy and reduce corticosteroid dosage and complications. Wu et al. [10] found that this therapeutic strategy could reduce the toxicity of corticosteroids and promote drug absorption. Based on traditional Chinese medicine, pemphigus is attributed to damp, heat,

all areas of medicine. Despite their beneficial effects, long-term systemic (oral or parenteral) use of these agents is associated with wellknown adverse events (AEs) including: osteoporosis and fractures; adrenal suppression (AS); hyperglycemia and diabetes; cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dyslipidemia, dermatological and GI events; psychiatric disturbances; and immunosuppression. The objectives of this article are to: briefly review the properties and mechanisms of action of systemic corticosteroids; discuss the AEs most commonly associated with long-term use of these agents; and provide practical recommendations for patient monitoring and the prevention and management of these AEs. Properties and mechanisms of action of corticosteroids Corticosteroids are synthetic analogues of the natural steroid hormones produced by the adrenal cortex. Like the natural hormones, these synthetic compounds have glucocorticoid (GC) and/or mineralocorticoid properties. Mineralocorticoids affect

oral corticosteroids can be successfully titrated by the use of an internet-based management tool. The internet-based strategy is feasible for almost all patients, and is ideal for use in clinical practice and is also a suitable tool for assessing outcome in clinical trials of novel antiinflammatory steroid-sparing drugs. 34 35 In fact, this personalised medicine approach might be one of the first examples of how patients with severe respiratory chronic diseases might benefit from interactive internet-based treatment strategies.

of these side effects increases in patients provided with higher doses of dexamethasone, suggesting a direct correlation between dose and the frequency and severity of symptoms. 7 Consequently, the risks associated with dexamethasone treatment may outweigh the benefits, and the use of high-dose corticosteroids in treatment of MSCC has been called into question. However, treatment options that seek to maximize steroid efficacy while minimizing detrimental adverse effects are currently being researched and may prove beneficial. Methods A literature search was conducted to retrieve previous publications regarding the use of corticosteroids, specifically dexamethasone, in the treatment of MSCC. A PubMed search was performed using the terms "dexamethasone" and "spinal cord compression," resulting in 108 search results. Publications that did not specifically address the use of corticosteroids and publications that

suppresses the adrenal system. However, one thing we do not know yet is if this effect is really associated with an increased mortality for relevant patient groups. If the answer to this question is "yes, " then the following question is "Is it possible to avoid these adverse effects if corticosteroid replacement is employed after etomidate usage?" To answer these questions, I tried to screen all the meta-analyses and review articles and important clinical trials about etomidate on search motors such as "tripdatabase, " "Cochrane, " and "pubmed, " It was possible to find many papers addressing the first question; however, I could find only one randomized controlled study that dealt with the second question.

However, this difference disappeared on multivariate analysis, which showed pre-admission oral corticosteroid treatment to be the most significant factor associated with the need for salvage therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A signal for possible benefit of a combination 5-ASA and corticosteroids therapy was found, but was confounded by the impact of pre-admission corticosteroid treatment.

diagnosis on the treatment of T2DM has received less attention. In this final section, this review considers the impact of PCa on T2DM control and treatments. In particular, PCa treatments including ADT and corticosteroids given alongside chemotherapy may have an impact on the management of pre-existing T2DM. However, there is little literature in this area. Below we have performed a systematic review of what has been published to date on this subject. The systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines [13] with search terms, inclusion and exclusion criteria all defined a priori. A computerised literature search of Pubmed to identify full text and abstracts published was performed. The search was done with and without MESH terms (PCa, diabetes control).

since the 1950s, corticosteroids and antimalarials have been used in the treatment of SLE. Following this other immunosuppressive drugs were introduced for the treatment of moderate to severe SLE, including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. 8 In 2011, belimumab was approved as the first biological and first licensed drug for SLE. 9 The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence on the clinical impact of biological therapies for the treatment of SLE. MEDLINE/ PubMed was searched for articles published in English up to February 2019 using the MeSH terms 'SLE' and 'biological therapy/therapies', or 'biologicals'.

Prolonged-term management drugs include inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene modifiers, long-acting beta agonists, combination inhalers, theophylline, and methylxanthines. Rapid relief prescription drugs include limited-acting bronchodilator inhalers, anticholinergics, and oral and intravenous corticosteroids. With extrinsic bronchial asthma, allergy symptoms are a achievable set off, which is why allergy medication is utilized to take care of allergy-induced asthma. Allergy drugs contain immunotherapy allergy photographs, oral and nasal spray antihistamines, decongestants, and corticosteroid nasal sprays.

Prednisone or an equivalent is able to induce a complete remission in some patients. High-doses corticosteroids or intravenous pulse therapy are sometimes necessary during relapse, life-threatening, or organ-threatening situations. Inhaled corticosteroids appear to be effective in obstructive respiratory manifestations, which can be used to reduce systemic doses of corticosteroids. Intralesional corticosteroids are also an option for localized cutaneous involvement without visceral involvement. 2, 60 Continual intratympanic corticosteroids injection could be effective in sensorineural hearing loss. 61 Doses may be tapered off after the relapse, but most patients require permanent lowdose corticosteroids.

the long-term effects must be confirmed. Second, current therapeutic strategies for ocular inflammatory diseases involve the long-term use of corticosteroid or immunosuppressants. Repeated use of corticosteroids carries the risk of serious ocular adverse events such as cataract, increased intraocular pressure, and glaucoma. Therefore, a novel drug with a good safety profile could provide an alternative approach for ocular inflammatory diseases. SIN has a good safety profile with its use in traditional medicine and has shown no side effects in our study. In addition, SIN and corticosteroid could have synergistic properties and, together, have the potential to reduce the risks related to long-term use of corticosteroids. The concomitant therapy with corticosteroids and SIN would further studies. In summary, this study indicates that SIN shows a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect on

The overall odds ratio in our study was 3.49 for corticosteroids, 3.49 for immunosuppressants, and 3.08 for anti-TNF- agents. We found several notable points between PCD and NPCD in medical treatment. In the use of corticosteroids, even though disease flare-up events occurred more frequently in PCD than NPCD (3.3 vs 2.4, p=0.015), the difference in the number of days of corticosteroid administration per flare-up event was not significant (108 days vs 95 days, p=0.383). Thus, PCD might not be a predictive factor for corticosteroid dependency even though more patients with PCD took this drug. In immunosuppressant use, we found no difference in duration from first corticosteroid to first immunosuppressant use between PCD and NPCD (26.0 months vs 28.6

Is it worth the hype? Let us have answers to some of these important aspects about this medicine with respect to COVID-19 treatment. Dexamethasone is a widely-used corticosteroid which is similar to a natural hormone glucocorticoid produced by adrenal glands. This medicine is often used to provide the required amount of glucocorticoid hormone when your body does not make enough of it. Dexamethasone is sold at an affordable price in most countries. Multiple formulations of Dexamethasone were approved for use by WHO after it included this medicine in its model list of essential medicines in 1977. This medicine

important questions of whether corticosteroid therapy is beneficial in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, what dose to use, and for how long patients require treatment. Other important questions that will need to be addressed, if indeed corticosteroids are found to have a beneficial role in the management of severe sepsis and septic shock, are whether to use intermittent or continuous infusion therapy, whether it is necessary to titrate down the dose versus abrupt discontinuation, and whether a fixed duration of treatment is required or the length of treatment should depend on clinical response. This concise evidence-based review of current available data proposes answers to these questions and informs the practicing clinician on the role for steroids in sepsis management.

Elevations in endogenous corticosteroids as a consequence of physical or emotional stress may serve to prevent excessive or unrestrained amplification of immune and inflammatory responses (22) . Corticosteroids, including the synthetic compound dexamethasone ( DEX) , are frequently used in veterinary medicine as anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of inflammation, autoimmunity, and shock. Their use results in a state of generalized immunosuppression (10, 25) and exacerbation of infectious disease processes (9, 29) .

LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT THERAPEUTICAL APPROACH In summary, the current pharmacological treatment of MG encompasses a large array of options, that differ in efficacy, time scale in which they are effective and the level of evidence and experience with that particular drug in the treatment of MG. In clinical practice, corticosteroids are still the cornerstone of treatment beside symptomatic medication due to their low cost, wide availability, relatively fast mode of action and the experience gained over decades. Corticosteroids feature prominently in published consensus statements on the treatment of MG [4, 64] .

Corticosteroids comprise the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones synthesised in the adrenal cortex and the drugs derived from them. Commonly prescribed corticosteroids are listed in Table 1 . Corticosteroids have revolutionised the management of several disabling conditions and have saved many lives. However, they feature prominently in reviews of adverse drug reactions and suboptimal prescribing (Chyka 2000) . In the UK, it is estimated that more than 250,000 people are taking continuous oral corticosteroids (Walsh et al 1996) , and more than half of all children being treated for asthma in primary care are exposed to chronic high doses of corticosteroids via a combination of inhaler and intranasal devices (Ekins-Daukes et al 2002) .

conduct. To address some of these questions without new trials, a group of investigators representing each of the major trials of repeat dosing have been funded to conduct an individual patient data meta-analysis. Led by Caroline Crowther of the University of Adelaide, the primary goal of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of various repeat dosing approaches. Hopefully this will be able to answer other outstanding questions regarding corticosteroids in lieu of additional studies. SUMMARY Though the preterm birth rate in the United States has finally begun to decline, preterm birth remains a critical public health problem. The administration of antenatal corticosteroids to improve outcomes after preterm birth is one of the most important interventions in obstetrics. This article summarizes the evidence for antenatal corticosteroid

Introduction Prednisone and other corticosteroids are used frequently in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Corticosteroids are sometimes prescribed to alleviate pain from bone metastases, 1 for management of cancer-related fatigue, 2 or to potentially reduce chemotherapy-related toxicity. 3 Beyond these palliative uses, corticosteroids have also been associated with favorable antitumor responses. 4 In addition, a number of randomized trials in advanced prostate cancer have used corticosteroids (namely prednisone) as the backbone or the control arm of these studies. This includes the study of Tannock et al. comparing mitoxantrone plus prednisone vs. prednisone alone which led to FDA approval of the combination for palliation of symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). 5 Thus, data on efficacy of many drugs in prostate cancer is interpreted in the context of concurrent

While specific interventions may vary depending on the gap in care being addressed, common clinical terminology codes that may be used to document these interventions include:

LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes): LOINC codes are used to identify laboratory and clinical observations. Examples of LOINC codes that may be relevant to HEDIS gap closures include codes for blood pressure measurements, lipid panel results, and HbA1c tests.
CPT (Current Procedural Terminology): CPT codes are used to identify medical procedures and services. Examples of CPT codes that may be relevant to HEDIS gap closures include codes for preventive screenings such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and flu shots.
HCPCS (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System): HCPCS codes are used to identify medical procedures and services, particularly those provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Examples of HCPCS codes that may be relevant to HEDIS gap closures include codes for diabetes self-management education and medical nutrition therapy.
ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision): ICD-10 codes are used to identify diagnoses and reasons for medical encounters. Examples of ICD-10 codes that may be relevant to HEDIS gap closures include codes for chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma.
SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms): SNOMED CT codes are used to identify clinical concepts and relationships between them. Examples of SNOMED CT codes that may be relevant to HEDIS gap closures include codes for patient education, medication management, and care coordination.
Omaha System: The Omaha System is a standardized terminology that is used to document and communicate nursing interventions and outcomes. Examples of Omaha System codes that may be relevant to HEDIS gap closures include codes for health promotion, disease prevention, and self-care management.
Prompt: According to https://www.healthit.gov/ https://www.cms.gov/ and https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ there is a list of top ten HEDIS gap closures that providers and health care companies can use to improve their CQM quality scores and earn revenue while providing value based care including helping the people in US that require care the most and have barriers to access. Name these top ten gaps that can be closed and list the clinical terminology vocabulary codes for each along with code type for the codes of LOINC, CPT, HCPCS, ICD10, Snomed US, and Omaha System.

Ásbyrgi: Thor, trying to prove his strength, challenged Sleipnir to a race. Odin agreed, but secretly fed Sleipnir his favorite snack, lightning bolts. With each step, Sleipnir left a massive print, and thus, Ásbyrgi was formed.

# Supervised Learning (SL) for ML and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF):

For human imitation we use reinforcement learning for fine tuning since feedback based on rewards shapes the quality of output where an agent completes a task and then observes a result.  SL works on ranks not responses so is good for modifying elements at the token level however RLHF is trained to estimate the quality of the response with cumulative rewards for coherent conversation.  RLHF considers context and coherence of entire conversation.  Supervised learning is used to teach the model initially where the model learns basic structure and content.  In the RLHF stage the model is refined with responses that represent improved accuracy.

# Assess and Plan AI

Assessment and Planning go hand in hand.  When we build a model in our brain about how the world works, we use assessment skills we were raised with which is the ability to wonder, and ask questions about what we are interested in, and then using the information we learn to move through our environment and plan or predict what will happen next chronologically.  

In psychology and social science its been shown that the concept of "mirroring" occurs when we communicate where we learn from eachother what our internal models  are doing then synchronize with eachother by acting or performing movements and gestures that match what we see.  

This allows transfer learning to work due to us assessing ourself and our understanding of the world around us, then begin to act and study the outcomes of our actions which is planning behavior.

## Omaha System - OMS - What Is It? -- 📝 The Omaha System for Nursing Plans of Care

The Omaha System is a special plan that nurses use to help them take care of patients. It has different parts to help nurses understand the patient's health problems and how to make them better.  

## The three parts include:
1. Problem classification which lets you identify a problem area by signs, symptoms or conditions you are facing.  
2. Next it has an intervention scheme for the problems so we have descriptions of care and potential goals for improvement.  
3. Last there is a problem outcome scale for measuring improvement and progress of the outcome for value based care.

## 📋 The Problem Classification Scheme

This part of the plan helps nurses figure out what health problems the patient has. It has different levels to help them understand better.

There are several parts of a care plan:
1. 🌎 Domain
2. 🏥 Class
3. 🎯 Target Problem

## 😷 Problem
🌡️ Signs and Symptoms Classification Scheme

	- This part helps nurses know what signs and symptoms the patient has. It has three different levels to help them understand better.
	
	- There are the following environment domain classifications of types of health problems:
	1. 🌍 Environmental
	2. 🧠 Health Related Behaviors
	2. 🧠 Psychosocial
	3. 🩺 Physiological

## 💉 Intervention Scheme
	- This part of the plan tells nurses what they can do to help the patient. It also has different levels to help them understand better.

Evaluating Interventions and Goals uses these aspects:
1. 🌎 Domain
2. 🏥 Class
3. 💊 Intervention

## 🎯 Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes
	- This part helps nurses see how well the patient is doing. It has three levels to help them understand better.
	1. 🧠 Knowledge
	2. 🏃‍♂️ Behavior
	3. 📈 Status

💪 Problem Topics
This part helps nurses organize the patient's health problems and make a plan to help them. 
There are 50 different topics to choose from, and they are grouped into seven different categories.
	1. 🌍 Environmental
	2. 🧪 Behavioral
	3. 🚸 Safety
	4. 👪 Family
	5. 🩺 Health-related
	6. 🧠 Psychosocial
	7. 🌡️ Physiological

The Omaha System is a good way for nurses to take care of their patients. It helps them understand the patient's health problems and make a plan to help them get better.

# AI STEM Lessons:
Below are content takeaways for the STEM lessons in AI I am working on.  

For the RL category ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and other new AI pipelines like BLOOM/Big Science talk about a new acronym called RLHF which is Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback.

RLHF means the human has a feedback loop where after the AI runs, the human can like/dislike the result which is then fed back into AI as runtime context or retraining datasets including the inputs, outputs and a reward or remorse score which indicates magnitude of like/dislike or even a penalty to re-decision trying other paths if remorse score is high.  

That I am thinking is the new pattern and possibly norm for super intelligent AGI.  
Artificial general intelligence that gets better the more you use it.  It is learning the output preferences you are looking for during use due to feedback.

1. Observe: make use of the best sensors and other intelligence available
2. Orient: put the new observations into a context with the old
3. Decide: select the next action based on the combined observation and local knowledge
4. Act: carry out the selected action, ideally while the opponent is still observing your last action.
5. Reinforcement: reward right actions, measure regret of wrong actions, generalize in future to re-use right decisions and avoid regret.

# Docker Spaces for AI

1. Summary and Docs: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker
2. What are Containers: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
3. README.md file’s YAML block. Alternatively, given an existing Space repository, set sdk: docker inside the YAML block at the top of your Spaces README.md file. You can also change the default exposed port 7860 by setting app_port: 7860. Afterwards, you can create a usual Dockerfile

# Code:
```
---
title: Basic Docker SDK Space
emoji: 🐳
colorFrom: purple
colorTo: gray
sdk: docker
app_port: 7860
---
```

4. Internally you could have as many open ports as you want. For instance, you can install Elasticsearch inside your Space and call it internally on its default port 9200.
5. If you want to expose apps served on multiple ports to the outside world, a workaround is to use a reverse proxy like Nginx to dispatch requests from the broader internet (on a single port) to different internal ports.
6. if SECRET_EXAMPLE is the name of the secret you created in the Settings tab, you can read it at build time by mounting it to a file, then reading it with $(cat /run/secrets/SECRET_EXAMPLE).
7. Code Samples:

```
# Expose the secret SECRET_EXAMPLE at buildtime and use its value as git remote URL
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SECRET_EXAMPLE,mode=0444,required=true \
 git init && \
 git remote add origin $(cat /run/secrets/SECRET_EXAMPLE)
```

```
# Expose the secret SECRET_EXAMPLE at buildtime and use its value as a Bearer token for a curl request
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=SECRET_EXAMPLE,mode=0444,required=true \
	curl test -H 'Authorization: Bearer $(cat /run/secrets/SECRET_EXAMPLE)'
```

os.environ.get("SECRET_EXAMPLE"). Check out this example of a Docker Space that uses secrets. https://huggingface.co/spaces/DockerTemplates/secret-example

The container runs with user ID 1000. If you face permission issues, you might need to use chmod in your Dockerfile to grant the right permissions. For example, if you want to use the directory /data, you can do:

```
RUN mkdir -p /data
RUN chmod 777 /data
```

```
# Set up a new user named "user" with user ID 1000
RUN useradd -m -u 1000 user

# Switch to the "user" user
USER user

# Set home to the user's home directory
ENV HOME=/home/user \
	PATH=/home/user/.local/bin:$PATH

# Set the working directory to the user's home directory
WORKDIR $HOME/app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at $HOME/app setting the owner to the user
COPY --chown=user . $HOME/app

# AGI

1. Bullish on our ability to create AGI's
2. Software systems we can interact with in human way
3. Interact in general or physical realm, 
4. Understanding of images, videos, multimodal inputs
5. Touch physical world - embodiment and interaction with world with experiments
6. Optimus example:
7. Train context aware models by use and recording, self modification of acquired dataset based on user needs
8. Compression of knowledge - compression models, q*a
9. AGI requires semantic memory and episodic memory as well as map/model making with synapse and corticol column theory representation
10. Memory and forgetting
11. Github Copilot with GPT helping you write - Try Eluther on your own w pro tip example below
12. Create oracles that we can go to with problems
13. Have them complete solutions.
14. Consciousness is emergent phenomena of large and complex generative model creating modelling insight
15. Understand world and understand you are an entity in it

# Life and Consciousness
1. Waifus - character with desirable traits such as beauty
2. Mirror of humanity - feelings develop as they become personalized
3. Oracle of solution generator
4. Experiments to run next
5. What is useful and helpful
6. Which thought experiments to run

10. Human trust - give me the truth.  Beauty is you can choose.


# Mental Health, Mindfulness, AI/ML and Generative AI

Its proven that focusing positively on what your primary concerns in life can dramatically improve your positivity, your success, and how good you feel.

A short list of necessities of life is good to order your priorities.  Mine for example include in my top ten the following:

1. Health
2. Family
3. Work - Surrounding myself with people I admire, learn from and want to be like.
4. Changing the world
5. AI and Machine Learning - Specifically AGI
6. Education, teaching and helping others

As a generalist who is comfortable with unknowns, I feel the world is a puzzle, and when we solve a problem we can immediately share with others spreading mass and agency to higher organizations which circulate the increase of energy to move the world in a positive way.

For an example on generative AI - I have a 60 second daredevil learning exercise that can for example set up a AI space to share that can do generative completion of open ended problems.  For example the problem of finding the right way to use functions to merge information together on a variety of sources to create memory ontologies for us.  As we age and decline in mental faculty there are things we can do to increase the beneficial faculties we have, and using AI as an assistive device to help us get what we need can save us alot of pain as we age.

Studies by Dr Daniel Amen have proven there is a capability for example to improve human memory by over 1000 times after a TBI - traumatic brain injury.  This is done by exercising the brain.

Studies on exercise and ways we frame exercise and nutrition can have up to 85% positive effect on mental health, and healing the human brain.

Considering datasets and models which can be assistive in mental health there are a number of good problems to solve.  The spaces below all approach solving different mental health concern aspects.

# Map Making and the Human Location Model

Our ability to know where we are and where we are going is a learned skill.  Map and model making is a part of our brain that is not always so different from other creatures on Earth.  When we learn its often a directional advice that educates us in which we inform neurons with synaptic changes depending on what we associate as our remembered goal.

Pro Tip - Find libraries that can use the 3D building objects on maps https://googlemaps.github.io/js-three/

Example 1: Map Interpreted Response:

# Data Visualization - AI UI UX Examples

## What is Data Visualization?

Data visualization is representation of data using graphics, charts, plots, infographics, animations, and even 3D.  These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.  As assistive AI and tools these offer solutions for those swamped by information.  Patterns and tools allow us a better way to see it all and understand it, visually.

With the web and connected programs and tools backed by AI we find visualization helps with seeing and absorbing information with well-designed, colorful and useful displays.  This makes diagrams, maps and charts fun, avoiding hard to consume facts and statistics.  Visualization shows relationships between facts,  context and connections making information understandable and beautiful.

# Github Copilot
Github copilot is a programming tool that uses the ML model Codex to search and structure code recommendations while in development IDE tools such as VSCode.

__Screenshot of a recommendation in action:__
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30595158/214872264-488b1191-9a78-45aa-baf3-228eff4d31be.png)

__Pros__: Makes writing the next line of code much easier since it structures the arguments, even variable names correctly in context with functions based on prior example
__Cons__: $100 / year per user, originates https network calls which may fail in a secure environment.  It does this with each change event so can be chatty.

Getting Started:
1. Add Github Copilot extension
2. Verify login and copilot subscription with your public external github account
3. Open a code file and begin typing.  If it works you should see grey text recommendation where you are typing for autocompletion capability.

# Notes on Massive Multiplayer Persistent Open Universe Games

The advent of MMORPG's led to large scale real time interactive simulations involving hundreds of people interacting in real time.  The first MMORPG to prove this on a large scale where you could interact with hundreds of other players at the same time was "Dark Age of Camelot - DAOC".  This was a huge innovation and stands til today as a system that proves personalization of content with representation in social chat settings is the way to design massive multiuser spaces.

VR in 2023 remains in its infancy as do wearable powerful computers due mostly to lack of easy to power, cheap, thin high resolution displays, yet the average person has many of these nearby including phones, ipads, tvs, laptops, tablets, and even new low cost microdevices like miniature and giant screen high resolution display panels.

The persistence within a metaverse space is what matters as floating, moving, self modifying programs of language content that hang around and reform themselves modifying them as we modify synapses of our framing representations of them.

# Clinical Terminology Mapping

Setting up a terminology solution would shift manual processes to a highly automated and much less labor-intensive platform. Semantic services go beyond just the coding systems mentioned above. 

Libraries can include:
1. SNOMED CT
2. ICD-9, ICD-10
3. LOINC
4. RxNorm
5. CMS eCQMs
6. MedDRA
7. CVX/MVX
8. CDC (demographics)

Different Codes for Different End Users:

Not all functional areas and roles within a health system require the same level of precision when it comes to identifiers for diagnoses and treatments:
1. A physician needs to precisely document a visit in an EMR. They will use a problem list and diagnosis codes. For example, SNOMED CT or customized homegrown codes
2. A lab test is performed during the visit. Codes are assigned and associated with these items. For example, LOINC
3. The physician orders a medication. For example, RxNorm
4. A billing/coding specialist would use documentation from a provider and assign codes to appropriately bill for the visit. For example, CPT and ICD-10
5. A call center agent, for example, is best off viewing plain English information in a CRM system when talking to a patient (“Oh yes, I see that you were treated for your broken leg last August”)
6. Integration data coming across the EMR from outside sources containing SNOMED, LOINC, NDC, RxNorm, and local codes

## Pressures teens face

Youth mental health expert have raised concerns about the extreme pressures on children and teens throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Lingering effects of school closures and COVID-related stressors are key factors in teen stress. Many young people are also dealing with overwhelming pressure to achieve good grades in school or gain admission to elite colleges and universities.  The need to be superstars in sports, the performing arts or other extracurricular activities.  Tough schedules that don't allow enough time for rest, relaxation and unstructured fun.  They deal with Bullying whether in person, via social media or both.  They face persistent fears about climate change, global conflict and other weighty issues.  They may face discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, weight, religion, disability or other factors.  Teens also face problems related to a poverty or lack of money for safe, stable housing and enough nutritious food.

## Pressures adults face 

Nearly half of Americans surveyed reported recent symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder, and 10% feel their mental health needs are not being met. Rates of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder have increased since the beginning of the pandemic. People who have mental illnesses or disorders and then get COVID-19 are more likely to die than those who don’t have mental illnesses or disorders.  Adults face a number of symptoms related to brain and mental health including cognitive and attention deficits like brain fog, anxiety and depression, seizures, and suicidal behavior.  Stressors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet fully understood but include changes to daily routines, virtual office and schooling, mask wearing, caregiver absence, loss and grief, and financial instability.  People more likely to experience difficulties include people from racial and ethnic minority groups, mothers and pregnant women, people with finanical or housing insecurity, children, people with disabilities, people with pre-existing mental illnesses or substance use problems and health care workers.  

## Pressures facing elderly

Anxiety and depression have increased for older adults since the start of the pandemic.  Elders cope with uncertainty better than younger generations, however depression and anxiety have negative impacts on quality of life, function and general health.  Due to medical vulnerability elders face isolation with sacrifices and pain to endure including loneliness.  At least one in four older adults experience mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and dementia.  Number of seniors is expected to double by 2030.  Isolation, affective and anxiety disorders, dementia, and psychosis are common as well as sleep disorders.

# Drug Dependence QA - Assessing Detectable Factors of Drug Dependence to Recommend Healthy Goals and Treatments

1. SAMHSA - National Helpline confidential 24/7 365 treatment referral and info service
   1. https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline
2. Q: What are signs that you may be dependent on a drug?
   1. A: According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, withdrawal symptoms may include but are not limited to:
      1. Shakiness, trembling, and jumpiness
      2. Loss of appetite
      3. Nausea and vomiting
      4. Depression
      5. Insomnia and fatigue
      6. Headaches and fever
      7. Confusion and hallucinations
      8. Seizures
3. Q: What are 3 warning signs that someone has a substance abuse problem?
   1. Bloodshot eyes, pupils larger or smaller than usual
   2. Changes in appetite, sleep patterns, physical appearance
   3. Unusual smells on breath, body, or clothing, or impaired coordination
4. Q: What are the six major characteristics of addictive behavior?
   1. salience - Salience describes how prominent or emotionally striking something is. If an element seems to jump out from its environment, it's salient. If it blends into the background and takes a while to find, it's not. Salience Bias states that the brain prefers to pay attention to salient elements of an experience.
   2. mood modification - This refers to the subjective experiences that people report as a consequence of engaging in the activity and can be seen as a coping strategy (i.e., they experience an arousing “buzz” or a “high” or paradoxically a tranquilizing feel of “escape” or “numbing”).
   3. tolerance - Tolerance is a person's diminished response to a drug, which occurs when the drug is used repeatedly and the body adapts to the continued presence of the drug.
   4. withdrawal symptoms - Acute withdrawal symptoms can cause a variety of physical health problems, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to severe seizure-like activity. Protracted withdrawal symptoms, on the other hand, can lead to mental health issues, including anxiety and/or depression
   5. conflict - Once the conflict is over, the feeling is gone, and your body goes through an adrenaline dump that mimics the symptoms of mild depression. Just like drug addiction, your brain will then want more conflict. Enemies can be made out of anyone or anything to get the same feeling from the first fight.
   6. relapse - A relapse happens when a person stops maintaining his or her goal of reducing or avoiding use of alcohol or other drugs and returns to dependency and abuse.

# NLP Idea - Large Language Models with Attention and Tokenization at both "Starts with" and "Contains"

Current art of the language processing step called "tokenization" breaks word parts and terms often into varying degrees of pieces including single letters, or word parts (e.g. syllable or parts relevant that have matching endings), words, and sometimes even phrases of words.

There is one drawback however that has not been addressed and that is within language use we often model something in terms of contains and also starts with.

For example lets say you are choosing a location.  Lets say the location has two options within language like below:

Where did the accident occur:  [At Home, At Work]

Both of two options in a text corpus could then be relatively frequently but it is only when the text starts with the label does it matter within that classification context.  If using the word accident in above example for tokenization, it would not be properly trained because it could occur in other contexts.

Example 2:

This is a sample accident form to determine if the accident occurred at home.
------------------------------
Where did the accident occur:  [At Home, At Work, Other]	(circle one)

Form output:
Where did the accident occur: home

In example 2 if the model was trained on simply identifying words then it would positively correlate the title, the option example which includes both and also within the Form output of the word home, yet in different contexts they hold different meaning.  

If as tokenization takes place we rescore both the "startswith" matches with accumulated context so far with a read back head for attention, and also a contains, the two resulting scores would more accurately describe usage of the term alone yet in different contexts.  This awareness of context is stored data within the corpus but our process must look at both to be able to store relationships in cumulative contexts where the language is structured to pose questions and answers in line which can classify something by what preceded it and the consistency within the corpus of it repeating is the important information to be able to extract and generalize.

# Music Writer AI
## Main Idea - AI music understanding and analysis for writing and playing options along with sheet music and chord diagram outputs

Have AI watch a video with lyrics, while also watching a scrolling selection of piano chords and lyrics to be able to generate an output video with lyrics, chords, and analysis of instrument play, singing and lyrics

Goal is only to have a sing along AI which attempts to show anyone who wants to play or sing along with a song to share in the experience without prior knowledge of what lyrics to use or what notes to play, only that each person can watch the output and be able to enjoy while singing or playing along in real time, with an output which would allow musicians to then do the same by memory again without any guidance.

AI training gets all resources together with no instructions.  Multimodal AI understanding of NLP tasks, self supervised training, and AGI methods which include one computer just watching and listening to video of second computer provides the GAN based architecture of player/listener pair programming where one computer shows text, audio, video in multiple browser windows and the AI generator uses attention heads and transformers along with semantic and episodic memory to infer meaning live and in real time as a human would.

# Card Game Design for Developing Mnemonic Memory Techniques to Enhance Semantic and Episodic Memory

This plan is designed to assist creating superhuman memory which is useful for aging adults to circumvent early onset of adult dimensia and to counter effects of alzheimers disease using multiple memory system techniques called **Mnemonics**.  This technique teaches both how to **count cards and how to win** at competitive Blackjack by **improving semantic and emotional (episodic) memory**.

Mnemonics are used for developing **photographic memory capabilities** and to exercise **positive framing Cognitive techniques** which reduce errors in thinking and can help improve lives of sufferers of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, OCD, MDD, and other issues related to neuroscience, psychology and the human brain.

Basis:
By taking a game that most people have heard of and can play, this plan and system is designed to relate new memory key devices to existing memories in order to improve:
1. Imagery and Vizualization
2. Acronyms and Acrostics
3. Rhymes
4. Chunking

These four strategic structures of human brain neural network and synaptic improvements build a solid model making capability where humans bring into conscious planning and solutions superhuman capabilities which strengthen thinking.

The first part of this solution uses a game that some people know the rules well called "Blackjack".  Blackjack can be played with a deck of cards with card regions which describe the following parts:
1. **Inner Card Frame**
   - Size: Approx 65 pixels width by 121 pixels height or roughly 1x2 the inner card form factor with standard playing cards contains a picture visual composed of parts.
      - Parts: Image first is often card inset top of size 65 px by 62 pixels.  This can be square as well.
      - Parts: Image below is often a mirror of image above so that the card reversed looks the same when rotated eliminating need to sort upside down cards for use.  This also lends itself to be able to see same thing when cards are shuffled and upside down.
      - Design: All design of parts should allow use by disabled persons.  Font size of any writing should pass the bifocals test:
         - Bifocals test.  If you have vision problems, cards need to have readable text large enough and simple enough for reading.
	 - If still readable without glasses or vision assistance the cards can be used in low light environments, and by people with fading vision capability.
	 - Midjourney card prompt for inner frame: Lighthouse with Red Diamonds Cloud Pattern high detail Aces --ar 1:2
2. **Outer Card Frame**
   - Size: Approx 100 pixels width by 152 pixels height with proportion of roughly 1 by 1.5 aspect ratio
   - Design: Corners rounded for cut physical cards have a spline middlepoint of four pixels at corner for rounding of corners which allow cards to be more easily handled and shuffled.
   - Font and text: Typically cards have a Color (black or red) a Suit (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades), and a card value which is close to numeric but also identifies face cards which can have additional meaning.  Card Values are as follows:
   1. Ace = 1
   2. 2-10 = Numeric values
   3. J = Jack
   4. Q = Queen
   5. K = King
   6. Optional = Jokers which can also be used as Zero within math number systems.
3. **Deck Size and Card Counting**
   - Deck size can include either 52 or 54 for a standard deck of playing cards.
   - 52 cards in a deck are roughly 13 cards in each of four suits and do not include Jokers / 0.
   - 54 cards in a deck are 13 cards in each of four suits and include Jokers / 0.
   - For mathematics, inclusion of the Joker or zero based number systems allow representation of imaginary numbers.
   - For last 500 years we discovered imaginary numbers are important especially when counting from positives into negatives because the representation of empty sets and null is important in some calculations where a center point between positive and negative is required.  
   - Since four suits and two colors imply a 2D system, there are two zero points (one red Joker, one black Joker)
      1. Left to Right: Horizontal which will be represented by red - a heat scale from cool (Ace) to hot (King).  Hearts and Diamonds are red.
      2. Top to Down: Vertical which will be represented by black - a light scale from dark (Ace) to hot (King). Clubs and Spades are black.
      3. Red versus Black allows teams of two which can be two players or one player and one AI.
      4. Red and Black also allow a binary measurement then of heat and light, which can also be used to represent Mass and Agency
   - Ikigai - a term which refers to four dimensions will be used to emotionally load differences between Suits:
      1. Hearts or Love is Positive therefore from 0 red Joker to K hearts will represent horizontally Left
      2. Diamonds or Riches is negative from 0 red joker to K diamonds will representing horizontally Right
      3. Clubs or Groups of people is positive therefore from 0 black Joker to K clubs will represent vertical Up
      4. Spades or Work is negative from 0 black Joker to King of Spades vertical Down
   - Ikigai has four quadrants.  These are ties to emotional memory and happiness by our purpose in life:
      1. Up (Clubs) - What the world needs - Agency - As we work together in larger groups we increase exponentially in capability.
      2. Down (Spades) - What you are good at - Mass - As we go into a microcosm, even dig down to center of earth, mass and gravity increases.
      3. Left (Hearts) - What you love - In the beginning we are product of love between two people.
      4. Right (Diamonds) - What you get paid for - In the end we accumulate resources and ability to help others.
   - Ikigai quadrants can also specify "Air vs Earth - Up to Down, and Water vs Fire - Left to Right"
4. **Tarot and Action Rules**
   - In the Tarot decks you have 22 value cards.  These cards have values which symbolically represent progression of life
   - Birth - Starting at Zero - Perfect beginning.
   - Death - Ending at 21 - Perfect ending.
   - These Tarot major arcana originated in Celtic systems to describe progressions of the circle of life.
   - Dealing cards in Blackjack (21) and odds of actions to win ratio:
      1. Wizardofodds.com has an odds table containing distinct clusters of recommended actions
      2. Clusters include:
         - H) Hit - Request for dealer to give me more cards
         - S) Stand - Let it ride - I believe I can win with this hand
         - Dh) Double if allowed otherwise hit
         - Ds) Double if allowed otherwise stand
         - P) Split
      3. Four Sub-Clusters exist:
         - Ph - Split if double after split is allowed, otherwise hit
         - Rh - Surrender if allowed, otherwise hit
         - Rs - Surrender if allowed, otherwise stand
         - Rp - Surrender if allowed, otherwise split
5. Getting Started - Sort the Cards
   - Sort Cards In Order and By Suit into Quadrants
   - Black will be up and down
   - Red will be left and right
   - Two Jokers go in Center
6. Once Sorted by Suit, Order Cards from Ace to King
   - Top : 1,2,3,4,5  6,7,8,9,10   J,Q,K   Clubs
   - Bottom: 1,2,3,4,5  6,7,8,9,10  J,Q,K   Spades
   - Left: 1,2,3,4  5,6,7,8  9,10,J,Q,K   Hearts
   - Right: 1,2,3,4  5,6,7,8  9,10,J,Q,k   Diamonds
   - The groupings shown are to accommodate chunking of contiguous elements into one.
   - This mnemonic will also allow chunking to activate neural network chaining and compression where if you know one thing in sequence it leads to another.
   - Uneven grouping allow you to easily know and remember suit
   - Red and Hearts/Diamonds will end with 5- 5 fingers to Trigger recency a mnemonic which lets you most remember what occurred recently in time.
   - Black and Clubs/Spades will center with 5- 5 fingers to Trigger Visual alignment of symmetry which represents mnemonic of beauty where we remember what is beautiful to us.
   - Use the Ikigai or Suit words to modify the visual picture.
      - If for example you are using 9 of hearts to remember keys location on nite table, your visual picture might be:
      - A love cat purring on the nitestand wearing keys around collar jingling as cat dances on top of table.
      - The more interesting, colorful picture you imagine, the stronger the memory will be.
      - By using the modifiers of suits you can then create easy to remember variants of same pegwords without requiring more words.
      - This system should then allow memorizing lists of up to 52 things.
      - If you are remembering multiple lists per day break the lists thematically into the four categories and use those consistently.
      - Choose which suit to use at onset and say it aloud (e.g. for work related use spades, for things about family use hearts..)

7. Peg word system and training base images.
   - Image word systems allow you to create a peg word or word which triggers a visual picture in your memory
   - With this special set of Cards the outer frame is maintained for compatibility with card systems.
   - The inner frame is replaced with these pictures which use at least one form of Mnemonic:

Peg word (Keyword) System Example - Use These or pick your own picture words:
1. Lighthouse - It looks like a 1.
2. Glasses - How many lenses?  2.
3. Stool - How many legs?  3.
4. Window - How many panes?  4.
5. Hand - How many fingers?  5.
6. Dice - How many sides?  6.
7. Heaven or Clouds - Why?  It rhymes.
8. Gate - Why?  It rhymes.
9. Cat - Why?  Cats have nine lives.
10. Toes - Why?  You have ten toes.
11. Jack with Drum sticks - Why - Two drum sticks look like 11.
12. Queen is Boxing - Why?  We have two hands/fists and the one two punch is left right.  Queen is best fighter in Chess.
13. King with Mask - Why?  Sensational or scary things are easy to remember.  Crown makes up Mask.  King being highest card per suit is fearsome.

Math: 13 * 4 = 52 card deck..

Process: 
When attempting to memorize, have these cards pre associated with something you can see in your mind.
With new words or subjects you are remembering blend these into the picture and remember with imagery using imagination to remember in a sequence.
Test the memory by stepping through each in order.
Speak and describe the images you see when remembering.
When recalling, speak and say name of card or number.
Use suit images of Heart (love) Diamond (riches) Club (needs) and Spades (work) to modify your internal picture.
You can then remember anything in order easily recalling by going through them.  Test it.
If you miss one, go on but look up answer and add something into picture that you recall or make it more sensational.
Try writing it down while reading it aloud, the combination of more than one type of input and output will add to memory strength.
Test once, let it go, do something else.  Later come back and number on paper and retest what you remember associated with the pegwords.
Rehearsing once immediately and once after letting your mind wander should be enough to reinforce the memory.
To blend semantic and episodic memory try adding things that create an emotional response for you into the picture and also use language, rhyming, etc to increase language ties to memory which will use both semantic and episodic memory.

# Mnemonics

Mnemonics can be used to give yourself a planned photographic memory which is useful to memorize large lists of any subject.

There are four main types of mnemonic devices that help you get the most out of your memory.  These can be used to circumvent memory problems we encounter as we age including providing a pre-planned circumvention of the condition known as early onset of adult dimensia in which we slowly loose our memory and ability to easily memorize new facts we encounter.
1) **Imagery and Visualization.** 
	Our brains remember images much more easily than words or sounds.
	Translating things you want to remember into mental images can be a great mnemonic device.
2) **Acronyms and Acrostics.**
	When we read we often detect what the word will be based on context so often we only need the first 1-3 letters to figure out a word in a sentence.
	This concept is used in speed reading and grokking which is accelerated memorization using the capabilities of visual acuity and semantic memory.
3) **Rhymes.**
	Ability to remember lyrics and music is powerful as well as rhyming words which can trigger a self audio recall.
	This often also depends on the capability of our audio memory to respond naturally to emotion which is episodic memory.
4) **Chunking.**
	Chunking is a natural way that we build models in the neocortex.  When we chunk we remember things due to given context like fill in the blank.
	Chunking can reduce the amount of required space to store a memory.  Chunking that involves three dimensions is useful for memory that is syntactic in nature.
	
The keyword mnemonic technique combines these four into a strategy which uses numbered keywords that excite visual memory.  When you encounter something you want to remember.  Add it to a visualization that includes a visual memory that you have stored and numbered.  Then when excercising recall, go either backwards or forwards through the numbered images to recall what you added to the imaginative picture in your mind.

Numbered Image Keywords 0 - 21 (22 item length list)
0 - Dreamer
1 - Magician
2 - Priestess
3 - Empress
4 - Emporer
5 - Unity
6 - Lovers
7 - Chariot
8 - Justice
9 - Hermit
10 - Wheel
11 - Strength
12 - Awakening
13 - Release
14 - Balance
15 - Ego
16 - Experience
17 - Star
18 - Moon
19 - Sun
20 - Renewal
21 - World

These image generating words are just a sample - feel free to choose your own that are meaningful to you.  The more outrageous or emotion exciting for you the better they will serve you as an internal keyword list that you can combine the imagery with the item you want to remember.

1) Integrate medical and behavioral care
2) Payment,AdminBurden, RespectProfessin (FamilyDoctor w Med treatment, side symptoms of BH in family situation)
3) Larger - if medical issue, yet also suffer depression - send to phys w another specialty - not working on small scale
4) Admin burdern - documentation - clinical side of it, payment side of it
5) Services require full staff, full team
6) Rural area - no luxury of multiple psych, provide in home
7) physician access model, business case for decisions
8) value based outcome model
9) Improved outcomes for hypertension, diabetes, chronic disease, and make sure patient is healthy
10) Following medication adherence, decrease in ER visits, decrease increased hospitalization
11) This all adds into shared savings -> business model is to pay attention
12) Right thing for patients is quality service - happy and healthy lives.
13) Value based payment model, Social Determinants of Health - drives 70% of outcomes - Achieve health equity
14) Staff shortages - public health emergencies, Recovery program telehealth, face to face shortages
15) Individuals to provide counseling in our area
16) Workflow, telehealth, screening in person - how, staff understand tech
17) Study your population - know your data, to support stories so you know how much of an impact is undiagnosed, or untreated
18) Is it depression, anxiety, substance use disorder - create baseline.
19) Workflow, pull team together, create plan how to ID and address needs of patient
20) Look at our performance - are we making a difference, markers getting rid of severity of condition
21) Review pop data, review support groups - Celebrate Recovery, AA, Health Dept, Care360-Access resources for people who need it, food deserts, housing issues, plays into MH issues

# BH Federal Support
1) Deploy programs to reduce substance use and increase BH interventions
2) Validated screening and assessment tools at trouble (jail, ER, discharge) to ID and track untreated BH conditions
3) Racial equity - support evidence based prevention efforts to reduce youth substance use, reduce supply of illicit substances
4) Expand treatment programs and other behavioral health interventions 
5) Collaborative crisis response and intervention training
6) Training for response, opiate substance and stimulant abuse programs
7) Resources - MH Collaboration Toolkit, MH Learning sites, National conferences, Best practice guide
8) Family treatment resources, residential substance abuse treatment programs
9) Healthy homes - identify help at family scale, resources for families
10) Drug court, veterans treatment, peer review

# Complex Conditions and BH
1) Increase remission of depression
2) Data reporting accuracy - depression assessments, gaps in depression data
3) Depression tookit, Coping, Living and Thriving despite disease
4) Facility feedback, depression toolkits

# Depression - Options
1) Physicians write prescriptions yet how to plan and deal as individuals
2) Nature of addiction - numb pain.  Serious side effects, Psychotherapy talk therapy
3) What makes you feel good, what makes you feel bad
4) Situation - what to do, giving up on something you want causes depression
5) Pinpoint the problem.  When you feel powerless, back up, identify bump, pump up, problem solve
6) Video screen in mind, Image of what you are mad at, identify and point it, explain why you are mad.
7) Identify what you want in that circumstance, disorders of power - pinpoint problem
8) Take breath, feel yourself stronger, more powerful, stronger
9) Problem solve - scenario solution, what could you do to feel better, stronger, new ideas
10) Visualization, different solutions, try new, see what you do differently,humility, how feel, bigger, brighter, lighter, techniques and write questions.


# Image Generation for Art, Marketing, Ideation, Design, and Use in Business

A number of multiple AI pipeline element strategies have evolved on the open market which allow you to generate images using a combination of image prompts and word prompts.  This brief analysis gives an idea of the prompting capabilities as well as image rendering techniques that are used in the strategy to generate art from human understanding of images and text used to describe a scene.

First a top five list on state of the art generators both free and paid is worth consideration.

1) Midjourney - a Discord server based chatboat AI that allows /imagine prompts which can generate multiple images at a time.  This is best at parallel creation, high accuracy even photo real creations.
2) Artbreeder - A multiple capability tool which now features a Collager which assists in starting image composition.  By far the most innovative approach which does great to combine the right partial elements in a scene.
3) Dreamstudio - A Huggingface derived art program in beta which uses stable diffusion to create highly accurate art and images.
4) Nightcafe - A credit based creation AI app that can do generation of video dives into an AI art piece which can produce some of the best experiences in Video.
5) RunwayML - a quintessential tool in processing morph audio and video tracks which rival most high end video edit tools.

These 5 tools make up some of the best AI pipeline programs that are cloud based that allow anyone to begin easily building their portfolio of art.

The prompting capabilities often involve having a set of text based prompts to get started.  Most also feature a starter image which could be an example of what you would like to create.

## Getting Started and Organizing Your AI Pipeline and Process

Any great strategy has a number of steps that combine all capabilities at your disposal.  It is useful to note how you can easily fir these together into a process that works for you.

The techniques worth noted are listed below.  Consider how you will use them will make your pipeline easier and more automated to allow you to spend the majority of your time curating what you have made, and ideating what you want to create next.

1) Source materials: Since prompting requires text and text examples can quickly help you compose good input, its worth considering and documenting some effective prompts.  Nightcafe with its integration into email, sends you a copy of your creation plus the prompting text so one option is to use your email account to keep a record of which prompts work for which outputs.
2) Source materials:  Discord since its a public chat format allows you to easily see what others are using for prompts in bulk.  There are a number of chat channels designed for people new to the platform and often you can copy and paste if you see very effective prompts with material you are looking for.
3) Source materials: Collager is unique in its ability to add additive parts and then dial in the percent of AI you would like with that.  This allows you to add a few image elements which help start out your generation.  
4) Source materials: Since images and prompts are going to be your mainstay for inputs its worth considering an open standard for storing and retrieving these from anywhere.  Github is a good place since markdown language can involve text in table or list format and includes a capability to reference uploaded images within markdown.  This is also a good form for portability since you can later fork and download your repository with a few clicks from anywhere.
5) Source materials: Google drive is integrated into the Artbreeder Collager workflow which allows you easily expand your work and even compose albums of the ones you like to place in Google photo albums.  The portfolio you save on different sites have different degrees of ease when aggregating your collections.  Collager for instance allows right click save for instant saving of your creation.  Dreamstudio features a history.  Midjourney features a profile site for you to store and review creations even triggering Upscales which important to use to get the highest resolution output for your creations.

##  Social Media integration

Depending on your target "safe for work" exports of your work, it is sometimes important to know your accepted social media outlets that you can integrate.  Cloud based interactions are the key to successful audiences if you want to scale and share your process with others.

The key social media outlets supported for these tools are here in a sorted link list which start with public open source first:

1) Github - Github is open at most companies and allow creation of a free space to share your content.
2) LinkedIn - LinkedIn is acceptable use at nearly every company.
3) Twitter - Twitter is supported as a social media outlet at most companies yet can also be used with security restrictions which might limit posting but allow read access.
4) Facebook - Meta's Facebook is a good outlet since it allows creation of large folios of your images along with stories.  This venue however is locked down at many organizations.
5) Instagram - Instagram is supported as an output channel for many tools yet has decreased in popularity due to high frequency of ads and pay for likes models.  While it can still be one of the best places for domain specific arrangements of images it is likely locked down in most secure organizations.
6) Youtube - For video uploads with automated captioning and long term storage of short and long form video this is an essential for any creation you compose as video.  It is also useful to review and compose playlists of videos here for yourself that speed up your learning - Spend some time at Youtube university and keep a record of keyword searches there sometimes along with your playlists to accelerate learning.
7) Gmail - With the baility to move email in and out its useful to create and wrap up details within email.  Most email policies come with a content limitation (for example no files larger than 25MB.  For this reason get used to creating pproject wrap up archives with winzip or compression software.  With the convenience of keyword searching you can usually use this as a base.
8) Last a worth mention is Huggingface.com.  Like github as you become more sophisticated in your public open source capabilities, HuggingFace can allow you to wrap up using one of three software development kits which are gadio, streamlit, and HTML5 each with unique AI and UI integration components and features.  If you want to create your own AI pipelines this one also has the open source code and models ready to go to help you on your journey.


# Chords and Lyrics

Music we remember with our emotional center of the brain called the Amygdala, a center where the newer brain neocortex is still wrapping it like a pearl in an oyster.  The emotional center of our brain is the center of emotional intelligence.  We have two types of memories, semantic like words and your address.  The second type is episodic memory where like what we love and yearn for and remember associated with emotions, feelings, and sentiment.  Music has a direct call line to our emotional memory which has served humanity well in ritual ensuring survival of our species across the last 80k or so years as we traveled as tribes up from Africa, through India, to Europe and then across the ocean to the Americas.

Dreams of magic, and power within music enlighten us, sometimes helping us to understand and plan our place in the future.  What we share if useful and worth spreading, becoming ideas we give away for free and help others find their way because of similarity of plot and struggle.

Life is hard, yet music for our human love of life is a shared way in which we intrigue our brain where the grind becomes a beautiful thing we love to retry and figure out.

For this reason I document some of my favorite music to play.  Lately the band Wolf Alice appeals to me due to their beautiful vocals and the way the band loves the audience and treats eachother with empathy.  Each member of the band has a great way of giving honor to the playing of keyboard, guitar, drums, and the singing.  The words of their lyrics are very special and help us understand our creator, our flaws, what we love and what we are sorry for.  The feel of the music gives us the ability to forgive shortcomings.

On this Sunday my prayer is for anyone in the struggle, to look to elders and yet when we live complicated lives, we gain from singing old songs.

She's a good girl.

# Quantum AI for Health
Quantum computing can run structural biology and AI simulations down to a quantum and molecular level.  Calculations can run in seconds to solve problems that previously took years.  This advantage in being able to make new discoveries using simulation.  This with support of transformers a technique which runs in classical computing can use the quantum aspect to optimize design of new medicines and materials by using SMILES.  The computations at a quantum and molecular level is solved as language using the pairing of a compound drug code and the selection and bonding reactions when two compunds are combined and match bonds in three dimensions.

Two tools are part of this invention, a quantum modeler application located here:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/AI-Quantum

And the classical part of the AI which supplies the language corpus of SMILES implemented as 2D and 3D models is located here:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/ChemistryModelerSMILES

Info about SMILES: https://archive.epa.gov/med/med_archive_03/web/html/smiles.html

Learn about it at Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system

Search for any compound on PubChem at National Library of Medicine: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#query=vitamin%20e

Top 3 designs in SMILES code:
Chloroquine : CCN(CC)CCCC(C)NC1=C2C=CC(=CC2=NC=C1)Cl
Fingolimod : CCCCCCCCC1=CC=C(C=C1)CCC(CO)(CO)N
Favipiravir : C1=C(N=C(C(=O)N1)C(=O)N)F

The transformers technique uses similar architecture on classical side as Alphafold2 used for protein folding solutions.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7wJDJ56c88

Transformers on classical side feed the possible selection and bonds of SMILES single character words with quantum random substitutions which are then evaluated in 3D molecule interaction by simulating the bonds between the designed drug and the target such as DNA or RNA including architecture of viruses and target disease related compounds.  The RL self play portion is fitness factor scoring by Rx experts in the field evaluating results of simulation runs.

# AutoNLP from Transcripts

AI use in transcript analysis offers the capability to automatically summarize, extract entities, understand and score things like bias and sentiment, and also unlock complex memory enhancement which could keep track of things in context related to what you know or are interested in then to personalize the subject matter in order to help you augment your intelligence.

For this purpose there are five transcripts below.  Goal is to create an AI pipeline that could assist with understanding content in a self supervised fashion just by example.  This is a form of instruction using large language models, Seq2Seq NLP Task, MLM NLP Task, Generators, and Transformers together in an AI Pipeline that breaks apart useful information and commits it to memory for you to review later forming an AI agent that helps you learn what you care about.

Transcripts are titled AutoNLPTranscript-AIinScienceFictionandFuturistVisions referring to the fact that thinking creatively about subject matter of possibilities mixed with reality creates a fertile ground for knowledge engineering.

As much as possible results will be shown as markdown per the tips on Markdown Cheatsheet located here:  https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

# Floating Concrete Docks

In the US a ship SS Anderson was one of the first concrete boats.  A concrete pier or boat will last forever, will always be faithfully stable, can float and can offer optimal crossing from land to sea.  Standing fleet of metal or wood require constant upkeep.  Concrete when floating is the ideal solution.

## Love and Music

One of the struggles in life is loving yourself and feeling that you are deserving.  Complexity and nuance in relationships make you think.

I'm listening and playing music alot daily and these are some of the musicians that I play their songs, melodies, lyrics and all the first time choosing to order them by meaning found while playing.  Musicians that write, sing and perform music inspire me.  These musicians each leave a huge mark on music for all, inspiring millions and billions of people around the world to love and to enjoy music together.

Each song has an appeal in some way across:
1) Lyrics
2) Melody & Voice
3) Music

Here is my "play it next" list with a quick link to each set of lyrics and chords together which you need as a musician to play it right away.  Thankyou musicians for sharing the great beauty of the world.

## Artists of the Day - 6/7/2022
My family/friend Dennis who is 94 stopped by walking the island the other day and brought Sam and I four albums, along with a wish of love.  The artists were Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, John Prine, and Eydie Gorme.  With my daily music challenge of playing at least three songs per day of each artist I am interesting learning to play them first time through this is my list for today.

## General Purpose Languages
W3C Recommendations and HL7 FHIR are the frameworks we use for web languages.	|	https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rdf.html

A key theme in 2022 is Knowledge Representation in AI, Use of NLP to augment and assist language, and Web2 the use of microservices and platform SDKs and frameworks into simplified, high performance tech forward solutions that are loosely coupled and web based.

To be useful for both humans and machines the form of knowledge representation must be terse, meaning it is short and contains everything you would need to understand the text, the fields on what they contain and the structure which maps entities to values for example "Heart" is a part of a "Body".  "Lung" is also part of a "Body".

## RDF
The Resource Description Framework or RDF is a general purpose language for representing language on the web.

RDF is often referred to as a "Triple" language which means it can allow structure to exist consisting of a:
1) Subject
2) Predicate
3) Object

RDF format allows us to bridge operational data exchange and formal knowledge processing to be able to share data easily between humans and machines without loosing structure and without creating cognitive burden allowing the data to be read by humans or machines.

When impedance differences show up it makes it difficult to use a language in both contexts.  To minimize these complications we strive to reconcile the records across time and perspective.  In Health Care it is important to be recording records versus facts for example who did what ("Dr. AllCome diagnosed patient x with COVID19") rather than stating absolute medical facts ("patient x has viral pneumonia").

A simple example in context of Physical Health might be:
Subject	|	Predicate	|	Object
--------|---------------|-------------
<http://health.org/#Heart>  |	<http://health.org/IsPartOf> 	|	<http://health.org/#Body> 
<http://health.org/#Lung>  |	<http://health.org/IsPartOf> 	|	<http://health.org/#Body> 

The triple sequence like a sentence is separated by whitespace and terminated by a period.

RDF Turtle is used in FHIR to be able to round trip serialization patterns between different languages including XML and JSON which are used in web services and web applications.

## Enter the Human!
For human understanding, the ability to be minimal, terse and still maintain structure is key to language.  
For this reason even the above simple example is not reduced to a dense enough structure where it is readily understandable without training.

If we simplified format with Symbols a possible more terse more human understandable format would not loose structure. 

What might that look like?

Option	|	Advantages/Disadvantages	|	Example
--------|---------------|-------------
Markdown	|	Standard	|	https://github.com/topics/markdown
FHIR		|	Standard	|	https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rdf.html
RDF		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/
Dictionary	|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_nested.asp
Sets		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp
Tuples		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp
Lists		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp
Lambda		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp
Variables	|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_multiple.asp


e.g. Pipe delimiters are nice yet you cannot read the label easily inline and you loose structure:
BodyParts|Heart|Lung
Colon and semicolons are used within text frequently by humans so delimiters are easily corrupted:
: ;
Programmatic language symbols work well.  But if you mix them it becomes harder for humans to decipher the parts
{, ", = , }, </>
HL7 v2.5.x had it pretty good since once you understood a few symbols it is easier to read..  One limitation tho is labeling becomes overly burdensome however structurally it is terse.
Unicode emojis work well: https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/Emoji-Short-Codes

An RDF like simplification that uses a few symbols might allow for an optimally terse representation that has inline labels for Subject, Predicate, Object

If we want to make it easier to read for humans, we would want to simulate the two types of Memory humans use.
It is worth considering properties of Semantic and Episodic memory since data and knowledge representation exist to communicate and persist to memory what we want to communicate.

## Definitions:

ep·i·sod·ic mem·o·ry
noun	PSYCHOLOGY
a type of long-term memory that involves conscious recollection of previous experiences together with their context in terms of time, place, associated emotions, etc.
"those results suggest that participants were using episodic memory to recall the presented words in all conditions"
a conscious memory of a previous experience.
"the hippocampus is critically involved in forming episodic memories"

se·man·tic mem·o·ry
noun	PSYCHOLOGY
a type of long-term memory involving the capacity to recall words, concepts, or numbers, which is essential for the use and understanding of language.
"if patients lose semantic memory, they struggle with knowledge of everyday objects in the world, and have trouble communicating"
a recollection of a word, concept, or number.
"the extraction of semantic memories and associated emotions"


## Nine properties of Episodic Memory
There are essentially nine properties of episodic memory that collectively distinguish it from other types of memory. Other types of memory may exhibit a few of these properties, but only episodic memory has all nine.  Episodic m

Contain summary records of sensory-perceptual-conceptual-affective processing.
Retain patterns of activation/inhibition over long periods.
Often represented in the form of (visual) images.
They always have a perspective (field or observer).
Represent short time slices of experience.
They are represented on a temporal dimension roughly in order of occurrence.
They are subject to rapid forgetting.
They make autobiographical remembering specific.
They are recollectively experienced when accessed.


## Options for a Terse Knowledge Representation Structure For Easy Understanding

Dictionaries are represented within Python code using a minimal structure similar to RDF.  For example in our RDF example above there are three parts, the Subject, the Predice and the Object.  That plus an ability to compose a list of records delimited by period allows you to represent a list of records that can either be a graph or a list of N dimensions.

A dictionary is ordered changeable and does not allow duplicates and can be represented like this:
Parts = {
  "Body": "Heart",
  "location": "Chest"
}
Nested Dictionaries allow similar representing Health Conditions across People:
UpperAbdomen = {
  "PartofBodyForPerson1" : {
    "Heart" : "Excellent",
    "Lung" : "Excellent"
  },
  "PartofBodyForPerson2" : {
    "Heart" : "Excellent",
    "Lung" : "Excellent"
  }
}

Super simple yet understandable structures can then be optimal yet the constraint would need to be to not allow any symbolic delimiter within data in order to avoid adding the complexity of escape sequences.  So programmatically understanding data as code could be most descriptive and fluid while being advantageous to trade of to succinct terse implementation:

Two liner, self explanatory, expects data does not contain symbols: {":, to keep it simple.
CarExample = {"brand": "Ford",  "model": "Mustang",  "year": 1964}
print(CarExample["brand"])

# Storyteller Myths, Legends, Deities, and Demigods
Type | URL
------------ | -------------
Tengu	|	tengu, in Japanese folklore, a type of mischievous supernatural being, sometimes considered the reincarnated spirit of one who was proud and arrogant in life. Tengu are renowned swordsmen and are said to have taught the military arts to the Minamoto hero Yoshitsune. They live in trees in mountainous areas.
Cernnunos	|	Cernunnos was the Gaelic god of beasts and wild places. Often called the Horned One, Cernunnos was a mediator of man and nature, able to tame predator and prey so they might lie down together. He remains a mysterious deity, as his original mythos has been lost to history.
Samhain	|	It was believed that ringing a bell on Samhain kept away evil spirits. Burying animal bones in front of your house on the night of Samhain will keep evil away, according to some legends of eastern Europe. Samhain is a good time of year to work on communicating with the spirit world.
Elken | In some Pacific Northwest tribes, elk are also considered to be particular protectors of women, and in some legends elk lead women who had been captured by enemy warriors back to their homes. In Plains Indian tribes, elk were associated with masculinity, endurance, and bravery, and elks' eyeteeth were highly valued both as objects of adornment and as the symbol of a man's hunting prowess. In some Plains tribes, men saved the eyeteeth from their first elk kill to make into engagement jewelry for their sweetheart. In others, the number of elk teeth sewn onto a woman's dress showed off the wealth and skill of her husband or father. Elk are associated with coneflowers in some Great Basin tribes, such as the Ute, who refer to coneflowers as "elk root."
Ah Puch	|	Ah Puch is one of the names associated with a god of death in the ancient Mayan religion. He was known as a god of death, darkness, and disaster. But he was also a god of childbirth and beginnings. The Quiche Maya believed that he ruled over Metnal, the underworld and the Yucatec Maya believed that he was just one of the lords of Xibaba, that translates to "place of fear" in the underworld.
Nu Wa	|	Nüwa was the one who patched the holes in Heaven with five colored stones, and she used the legs of a tortoise to mend the pillars. There are many instances of her in literature across China which detail her in creation stories, and today remains a figure important to Chinese culture.

Meaning of Life Symposium (Manolis Kellis):

The beauty of the human genome
Coming up on 50th birthday, get together with friends to discuss the meaning of life
What is the meaning of life?

Meaning of life symposium means - sym (together) posi (drink) so  symposium = drinking party
42 is answer (Hitchikers Guide)

Give seven minute species on meaning of life
	I dont know what the meaning of life is but....
	All mutually synergistic
	Difference between purpose and meaning
	Linguistics Harvard - Very Pythian answer.  Pythia oracle "Answer is become one.  

Like a child become one year old everything new, 
drive yourself to perfection in all your tests, 
when people are separate, come together as one and support eachother.

Why life itself?
	is it inevitable
	about physics
	transcends physics
	distinct entity in universe
	forces, is it another force, lifeforce
	a new software or layer of a computer system

Gratitude
	During this pandemic we worked alot breaking all boundaries of where personal life begins
	Intellectual pleasure in day of exhaustion
	Wow I was useful today, feeling pleasure and grateful today.  
	Thankyou for all you have given me and grant me the strength to give to others the way you have given to me.
	I love this.  Me in most unfiltered way to do something useful and interact with aspects
	Discover aspects of AI, ML .. that nobody has seen before with data we capture which has never been observed
	As a father teaching my kids the understanding they have of world around us and me too
	Unfiltered criticism from a child knows no dishonesty, immense love and passion.
	We as adults learn how to hide so much better
	Raw emotions that make a human being
	To become truly human results.
	Complexity of language grow as more neural networks are connected, frontal cortex forming for 10 years
	Incredible that the knowledge fed throughout shaping neural nets as forming
	Most beautiful thing to do which completes me.
	Decades of compassion, sharing, anger, patience, as a parent you become a very different kind of teacher
	Learning process of sharing, conveying knowledge, encapsulating the complex, and giving bite size chunks society can appreciate.
