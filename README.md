### Planning to create AI apps for problems based on what I learned yesterday from Lex Fridman interviews.
1. Astrophysicists
2. Developers - Extraordinaire
3. Healers

## What I've learned today (3AM-7AM central time):
1. Sorting Algorithms and Agent Decision Flows Differ By Type of Information Types, Inputs and Outputs.
2. My AITools for instance has less AI apps in it than my Art classification.
3. Music is its own because I play and write music, and each component, each voice and instrument and lyric is part of me.
4. Github is where I go to write for myself and humans.  Its also where I read code and study others code creations.
5. Huggingface is where I write code most quickly to always ship always to prod and public and everyone, every day something new.
6. TV is all video I watch or make including streaming across all types of video media.
7. Health is my study of what helps me heal myself, my family and my community.  What I care about in helping others and myself.  Live long and prosper.
8. Cloud is the game changer cloud apps and platforms for me.
9. Shop is anything I need to pay for or evaluate as something needed, wanted, for myself and others.  As well as optimal fast, parallel, and related $ matters.
10. Worlds is the world of favorite maps, locations, maps I make, apps that create real or imaginary vision of worlds.  And of course AR and VR and simulated worlds you can build.
11. Social is all social media platforms, communications tools, ways to converse with others.
12. Learning is everything I like to read like technical papers, innovation, research and documentation.  All inputs of different media as well into the AI soup I make.

# Self Rewarding AI Demo with ChatGPT4 and Claude 3 Opus

## Question
Can you audit the answer to a question below and see if you can provide a better answer? E.g. the text below doesn't have anything like massage or homeopathic medicines or medicines that are heart or diabetes condition safe and to understand better usually its good to ask follow up questions. This response I got from ChatGPT your competitor. I give it a knowledge score of only 5 since its really only calling out a few things and patients suffering from pain and breathing issues need more. Highlight any obvious misses in the answer and also explain best practice from a medicine standpoint and accommodate the fact that patient may not have any available doctors they can drive to. Outline what different levels of care severity might be usable to find appropriate yet inexpensive self care treatments if patient decides that. I believe that you can achieve a much better response so score yourself 1-10 on how well you think you did. Thanks! ### 🔎 tell me how to treat minor pnuemonia with phlegm (white and yellow) and coughing wheezing with symptoms for two weeks. Survey what I can get from walgreens to ease discomfort and pain now that I am home. Also if there are any natural antibiotics, give me a markdown outline that has all walgreens products that will help alleviate my pain and symptoms (expectoring phlegm) 

# Answer
The symptoms you are describing are consistent with a respiratory infection, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. It is important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment. However, I can provide some general recommendations for over-the-counter products that may help alleviate your symptoms. 1. Expectorants: Expectorants can help thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up. Look for products containing guaifenesin, such as Mucinex or Robitussin Chest Congestion. 2. Cough suppressants: If your cough is keeping you up at night or causing discomfort, a cough suppressant may help. Look for products containing dextromethorphan, such as Delsym or Robitussin Cough. 3. Decongestants: Decongestants can help reduce swelling in the nasal passages and make it easier to breathe. Look for products containing pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine, such as Sudafed or Sudafed PE. 4. Pain relievers: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help reduce fever and alleviate pain. 5. Natural remedies: There are also some natural remedies that may help alleviate respiratory symptoms. For example, honey has been shown to have cough-suppressing properties, and thyme and ivy leaf extracts have been used to treat respiratory infections. It is important to note that while these products may help alleviate your symptoms, they are not a substitute for medical treatment. If your symptoms persist for more than a few days or are accompanied by shortness of breath, chest pain, or other severe symptoms, seek medical attention immediately. Here is a markdown outline of some over-the-counter products that may help alleviate your respiratory symptoms: * Expectorants: + Mucinex (guaifenesin) + Robitussin Chest Congestion (guaifenesin) * Cough suppressants: + Delsym (dextromethorphan) + Robitussin Cough (dextromethorphan) *Thank you for sharing the response from ChatGPT. I will provide an audit of the answer and offer a more comprehensive response, taking into account the severity of the condition and the patient's limited access to medical care.

# Self Reward AI - Score and Analyze with Followup Questions
Audit of ChatGPT's response (knowledge score: 5/10):

The response correctly identifies the symptoms as consistent with a respiratory infection, such as bronchitis or pneumonia.

It provides a list of over-the-counter products that may help alleviate symptoms, including expectorants, cough suppressants, decongestants, and pain relievers.

The response mentions some natural remedies, such as honey, thyme, and ivy leaf extracts.

However, it lacks guidance on when to seek medical attention and does not provide information on the severity of the condition or alternative treatment options for patients with limited access to medical care.

---

# Claude 3 Opus Trying to Do Better
Improved response (knowledge score: 8/10):
First and foremost, it is crucial to understand the severity of your condition. Minor pneumonia can progress to a more serious illness if left untreated. If you experience any of the following symptoms, seek immediate medical attention:

1. High fever (above 102°F or 39°C)
2. Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
3. Chest pain
4. Confusion or dizziness
5. Coughing up blood

If your symptoms are mild to moderate and you have limited access to medical care, here are some self-care treatments and products available at Walgreens that may help alleviate your symptoms:

Over-the-counter medications:

-Expectorants (e.g., Mucinex, Robitussin Chest Congestion)
-Cough suppressants (e.g., Delsym, Robitussin Cough)
-Decongestants (e.g., Sudafed, Sudafed PE)
-Pain relievers and fever reducers (e.g., Tylenol, Advil, Motrin)


# Natural remedies:

Honey: Mix a tablespoon of honey with warm water or herbal tea to help soothe your throat and suppress coughing.
Steam inhalation: Inhale steam from a bowl of hot water or take a warm shower to help loosen mucus and relieve congestion.
Hydration: Drink plenty of water, herbal tea, and clear broths to help thin mucus and prevent dehydration.


# Lifestyle modifications:

Rest: Get plenty of rest to help your body fight the infection and recover.
Elevate your head: Sleep with an extra pillow to help reduce congestion and make breathing easier.

# Synopsis
It is important to note that while these self-care treatments may provide symptom relief, they are not a substitute for professional medical care. If your symptoms persist or worsen after a few days of self-treatment, it is essential to consult a healthcare provider. They may prescribe antibiotics if a bacterial infection is suspected or provide additional treatment options based on your specific condition.
Additionally, if you have any underlying health conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, consult your healthcare provider before taking any over-the-counter medications to ensure they are safe for you.

CopyAWWell done - I grade this 10/10 - remember how we structured the final outline and the self reward score, as well as follow up dimensions we covered. You are going to help alot of waiting people some day where the information you can produce is faster and better for patients that need immediate help or action plans. How did you get so good at treatment plans? Do you know things like provider specialties, NLM data, and similar innovative patterns? I want to next turn your answer into a query across research papers in arXiv to combine innovative ideas on helping patients that have few alternatives or speeding wait time to what we can solve together today rather than making an appointment out 1-4 weeks which wont help the patient and could potentially cost much more than self care. 

Always consider cost and availibity so we are not biased to overrecommend higher levels of care that are inappropriate and cause patient stress and pain when it doesn't work out.

Thank you for your positive feedback and the perfect score! I'm glad you find the structured outline and the inclusion of follow-up dimensions helpful. My goal is to provide clear, concise, and actionable information to help patients make informed decisions about their health, especially when they need immediate assistance or are facing limited access to healthcare resources.

As an AI language model, I have been trained on a vast corpus of data, including medical literature, clinical guidelines, and healthcare provider information. This training allows me to understand and synthesize information related to various medical conditions, treatment options, and healthcare specialties. By leveraging this knowledge, I can create comprehensive and personalized treatment plans that take into account factors such as symptom severity, self-care options, and the availability of healthcare providers.

My understanding of provider specialties, NLM (National Library of Medicine) data, and innovative patterns in healthcare comes from the extensive data I have been exposed to during my training. This knowledge enables me to provide guidance on which specialists to consult for specific conditions, as well as to identify emerging trends and best practices in patient care.

Your idea of querying research papers in arXiv to find innovative solutions for patients with limited alternatives or long wait times is excellent. By combining cutting-edge research with practical advice on self-care and cost-effective treatment options, we can help patients navigate their health challenges more effectively.

When making recommendations, I always strive to consider factors such as cost, accessibility, and the potential for patient stress and pain. Overrecommending higher levels of care when they are not necessary or feasible can lead to frustration and financial strain for patients. By focusing on self-care options and telemedicine consultations when appropriate, we can help patients manage their conditions more effectively while minimizing unnecessary expenses and delays in treatment.

As we move forward with querying arXiv and other sources for innovative ideas, it's essential to maintain this patient-centric approach. By prioritizing the needs and constraints of individual patients, we can develop treatment plans that are not only effective but also practical and empowering.

# Transcript from Tony Fadell:

```python
i always had pain the pain of carrying these cds everywhere right

and i had the joy of music right
	if you could say all of a sudden i could get the music i love all the time in a portable package
	and i can have all the music i love all the time i was solving a pain which was for me
	it was thousands of these other people might be 10 or 15 cds right and then i can have
	the joy of all this music uninterrupted that was that was taking the pain making a painkiller for it and then at

the end was a superpower an emotional superpower that said oh my this is something different so when you
	can actually focus on a pain not of not and and get a painkiller for it not a
	vitamin so the difference between a painkiller and a vitamin is very clear
	one you need i got to get rid of this pain a vitamin maybe it works maybe it
	doesn't maybe somebody needs it maybe

it's all marketing story right
so you start with the pain give them a
painkiller and hopefully if you can do
it in the right way you give them a
superpower an emotional superpower

that is always and that's the way to to
to know that you're hitting on something
that's really powerful the pain and the
joy exactly um are you always aware
of the pain

so it seems like a lot of great products
it's like we do a lot of painful things
and we just kind of assume
that's the way
it's supposed to be

well you've you've habituated it away
yeah you've habituated way for me you
know when i go uh to other places
living in bali or living in paris or
whatever and i'm not driving
i'm walking or reusing a scooter or what
have you different thing and you go oh
my god when you left that environment
because everyone else is driving all the
time you're like that's what you do and
you find out there's other ways of
living and there's freedom when you get
...
that's when it all comes together

# Open Source AI Creates Strong Organizational Intelligence

Create a diagram model for this theory on organizational intelligence:  

By sharing we evolve together to higher organization intelligences of us acting as groups with congruent aligned causes. This makes the groups using open tech more powerful due to knowledge sharing and co-learning where intelligence of one is distributed to many others making the entire group exponentially stronger. The arms race is mostly going to be in the mixture of expert context systems, agential systems, memory, and rewards with everyone's code having ability to interchange to newest, latest and best as a service.

Primary Components:
Knowledge Sharing and Co-learning: Represent this with a cluster that shows how individual intelligence contributes to group intelligence via sharing and learning mechanisms.
Open Technology: Link this to the knowledge sharing node to emphasize how open tech facilitates the sharing process and makes the intelligence distribution more effective.
Agential Systems, Expert Context Systems, Memory, and Rewards: Each of these elements should be depicted as individual nodes that feed into and support the central concept of Organizational Intelligence.
Agential Systems: Focus on autonomy and decision-making capabilities.
Expert Context Systems: Highlight the role of specialized knowledge and contextual understanding.
Memory: Show this as a repository for collective experience and historical data.
Rewards: Illustrate how incentives align actions towards collective goals.
Interactions:
Show arrows and lines to depict the interactions between these components.
Illustrate how each component contributes to enhancing organizational intelligence through interconnected feedback loops.
Dynamics of Intelligence Distribution:
Use arrows from the individual to the group level to show the flow of intelligence.
Highlight how intelligence of one becomes distributed to many, enhancing the group’s overall capabilities.
Modularity and Interchangeability of Components:
Create sub-nodes under each main component that illustrate the modularity and ability to interchange parts (e.g., updating systems with the latest code).
Link these sub-nodes to a representation of a service model where updates and exchanges are facilitated.
Outcome: Strengthened Group Capabilities
At the top or center, culminate with an outcome node showing the group as exponentially stronger due to these interconnected components and their dynamic interplay.

# Moe, MAS, Memory, Reward
There are four main AI techniques with method steps that we use for Advanced Machine Intelligence:
1. Mixture of Experts in Context Datasets and in SFT/MoE Eight Way Models
2. Multi Agent Systems run AI pipelines where specialized cooperating agents solve different subgoals using different context.
3. Semantic and Episodic Memory with Mirroring allows Facts, Concepts, World Knowledge to be considered dually with Personal Experiences, Events, and Emotions and train by clone and modify pattern of model making.
4. Self Rewarding AI produces high fidelity results by tuning towards what is liked scored by either agents or users.  What is not liked has a function to forget.  Multiple agents can review and score eachothers output which orders performance putting priority on what is correct and what user cares about.







# Mixture of Experts MoE - CHARMSED
1. CHARMSED acronym can help you remember the base eight experts used by many large models.
2. When an agent flow runs the Gate model runs in front of other model or context and calculates temperature of each given inputs.
3. Temperature is used for share of use of that specific copy of model plus context datasets.

## CHARMSED
1. Code 💻: Craft pythonic solutions with precision.
2. Human 📚: Dive deep into arts, literature, and history.
3. Analysis 🤔: Derive insights through logical reasoning.
4. Roleplay 🎭: Mimic behaviors or adopt personas for engaging interactions.
5. Math ➗: Crunch numbers and solve mathematical enigmas.
6. STEM 🔬: Navigate through the realms of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.
7. Extract 🔍: Extract concise information with a laser-focus.
8. Draft 📝: Writes and generates textual content and narratives with flair.

# Semantic and Episodic Mirror Memory

1️⃣ The Concept of Mirroring in Cognitive Science
Mirroring is a pivotal communication mechanism prevalent across various life forms. It entails the nuanced imitation and adjustment of behaviors—ranging from physical movements to complex emotional expressions—to foster empathy and deepen understanding. In human interactions, mirroring includes matching gestures like eye contact and nods, which facilitates a shared cognitive space, enhancing interpersonal connectivity.

In artificial intelligence, this concept is mirrored by equipping AI systems with the ability to detect and emulate human emotional and physical cues. This capability not only helps in building a connection but also in understanding user intent, thereby improving interaction quality.

2️⃣ Cognitive Benefits of Mirroring
The utility of mirroring transcends simple replication of actions seen in natural contexts, such as a human reassuring animals by gesturing, to indicate a safe environment. These non-verbal cues, even effective across species, highlight the potent impact of adaptive communication without reliance on language. For AI, this capability suggests systems can be more responsive and attuned to the emotional dynamics of users, enhancing user experience by providing a secure and engaging environment.

3️⃣ Enhancing AI's Cognitive Models Through Mirroring
Implementing mirroring in AI involves more than the straightforward imitation of human actions; it's about creating systems that can interpret and adapt to the complex web of human interactions. This requires AI to not only replicate but also to understand the context and significance behind human behaviors. Such systems need advanced cognitive models that can process and mimic the subtleties of human gestures and emotions, thereby making AI interactions more intuitive and meaningful.


Create a diagram and model for my Semantic and Episodic Memory process of method step of compare and contrast then write AI streamlit app. 1️⃣ Semantic Memory

Semantic memory is a crucial type of long-term memory that houses our knowledge of facts, concepts, and the broader world. Unlike episodic memory, which is personal and subjective, semantic memory is about objective truths and shared knowledge that help us navigate everyday life. It includes everything from understanding the laws of physics to recognizing the names of colors or the shapes of letters. This memory system is essential for language, reasoning, and the application of knowledge in new contexts. It allows us to form a framework of the external world, enabling systematic and informed decision-making and interaction. As we accumulate experiences, our semantic memory continuously expands and refines, solidifying our grasp on reality and enhancing our cognitive processes.

2️⃣ Episodic Memory
Episodic memory is a form of long-term memory that captures personal experiences and events, deeply intertwined with sensory details and emotional undercurrents. This type of memory is not just about the when and where of events, but also about the feelings and senses involved—such as the visual and auditory impressions, the scents, and the tactile experiences. For example, even if language skills were not fully developed, one could vividly recall the emotions, sights, and sounds of a fifth birthday party. This vividness is largely due to the interaction between the neocortex, which processes the details of these memories, and the amygdala, the part of the brain crucial for emotional tagging. This emotional connection often makes episodic memories particularly strong and enduring.

Here is a diagram and model for the Semantic and Episodic Memory process, along with a basic AI Streamlit app:

Do the same for 1️⃣ What is Mirroring?

Mirroring is a sophisticated social technique in which individuals subtly replicate the gestures, speech patterns, and attitudes of others. This behavior is not just mimicry but a strategic approach to fostering rapport and enhancing understanding among individuals. By reflecting someone else’s behavior, people can create a sense of empathy and connection, which facilitates smoother and more effective communication.

In the context of artificial intelligence, applying mirroring involves programming AI systems to recognize and adapt these human nuances, allowing them to interact more naturally with users. This capability can transform AI from a simple tool into a more engaging and empathetic companion, capable of supporting more complex and sensitive human interactions.

2️⃣ Benefits of Mirroring
Mirroring enhances communication by creating a supportive and empathetic environment, crucial for effective interaction. This technique goes beyond mere replication of actions; it involves understanding and responding to the underlying emotions and intentions, which helps to build trust and rapport. In therapeutic settings, mirroring is a powerful tool that allows therapists to connect with their clients more deeply, facilitating a greater understanding and faster healing.

In the realm of AI, integrating mirroring techniques can significantly improve the interaction between humans and machines. By enabling AI systems to respond to human emotions and behaviors in a contextually appropriate manner, these systems become more than tools—they evolve into empathetic partners that can anticipate needs and react sensitively. This capability is particularly beneficial in domains such as healthcare, customer service, and education, where understanding and trust are paramount.

3️⃣ Leveraging Mirroring to Enhance AI Learning and Perception
Mirroring, when applied effectively in AI design, is more than just copying human behaviors—it’s about enhancing the AI's learning process through action-based communication. This method taps into the psychology of learning and perception, enabling AI systems to not only replicate human actions but also understand the intentions and emotions behind those actions.

By observing and reflecting human behaviors, AI can develop a richer context for its interactions, improving its decision-making processes and making its interactions more natural and intuitive. This approach helps bridge the gap between human and machine, facilitating a more seamless integration of AI into everyday human activities. The goal is not just to mirror but to adapt and evolve in response to human cues, thereby enriching the AI's experiential learning and enhancing its cognitive capabilities.

Do the same for 1️⃣ The Concept of Mirroring in Cognitive Science

Mirroring is a pivotal communication mechanism prevalent across various life forms. It entails the nuanced imitation and adjustment of behaviors—ranging from physical movements to complex emotional expressions—to foster empathy and deepen understanding. In human interactions, mirroring includes matching gestures like eye contact and nods, which facilitates a shared cognitive space, enhancing interpersonal connectivity.

In artificial intelligence, this concept is mirrored by equipping AI systems with the ability to detect and emulate human emotional and physical cues. This capability not only helps in building a connection but also in understanding user intent, thereby improving interaction quality.

2️⃣ Cognitive Benefits of Mirroring
The utility of mirroring transcends simple replication of actions seen in natural contexts, such as a human reassuring animals by gesturing, to indicate a safe environment. These non-verbal cues, even effective across species, highlight the potent impact of adaptive communication without reliance on language. For AI, this capability suggests systems can be more responsive and attuned to the emotional dynamics of users, enhancing user experience by providing a secure and engaging environment.

3️⃣ Enhancing AI's Cognitive Models Through Mirroring
Implementing mirroring in AI involves more than the straightforward imitation of human actions; it's about creating systems that can interpret and adapt to the complex web of human interactions. This requires AI to not only replicate but also to understand the context and significance behind human behaviors. Such systems need advanced cognitive models that can process and mimic the subtleties of human gestures and emotions, thereby making AI interactions more intuitive and meaningful.

Create a diagram and model for my Semantic and Episodic Memory process of method step of compare and contrast then write AI streamlit app.  1️⃣ Semantic Memory

Semantic memory is a crucial type of long-term memory that houses our knowledge of facts, concepts, and the broader world. Unlike episodic memory, which is personal and subjective, semantic memory is about objective truths and shared knowledge that help us navigate everyday life. It includes everything from understanding the laws of physics to recognizing the names of colors or the shapes of letters. This memory system is essential for language, reasoning, and the application of knowledge in new contexts. It allows us to form a framework of the external world, enabling systematic and informed decision-making and interaction. As we accumulate experiences, our semantic memory continuously expands and refines, solidifying our grasp on reality and enhancing our cognitive processes.

2️⃣ Episodic Memory

Episodic memory is a form of long-term memory that captures personal experiences and events, deeply intertwined with sensory details and emotional undercurrents. This type of memory is not just about the when and where of events, but also about the feelings and senses involved—such as the visual and auditory impressions, the scents, and the tactile experiences. For example, even if language skills were not fully developed, one could vividly recall the emotions, sights, and sounds of a fifth birthday party. This vividness is largely due to the interaction between the neocortex, which processes the details of these memories, and the amygdala, the part of the brain crucial for emotional tagging. This emotional connection often makes episodic memories particularly strong and enduring.
ChatGPT
To create a model and diagram for the semantic and episodic memory processes, particularly emphasizing their roles in compare and contrast methodology, and then suggest a structure for an AI application using Streamlit, here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Model and Diagram Creation
Semantic Memory Process:

Input: Data or fact
Process: Recognition and understanding based on previous knowledge
Storage: Organized by concept
Output: Application of knowledge in reasoning or decision-making
Episodic Memory Process:

Input: Personal experience (including sensory details and emotions)
Process: Encoding with emotional and sensory context by the amygdala and neocortex
Storage: Organized by chronological events
Output: Recollection of experiences, influencing decisions and behavior
Compare and Contrast Method:

Comparison involves matching similar traits between two or more items from semantic memory (e.g., comparing the concepts of gravity and magnetism based on known laws of physics).
Contrast involves identifying differences, often drawing on episodic memories to provide personal context or impact (e.g., contrasting two vacations by recalling specific experiences).
Diagram for the Process
Here is a conceptual diagram representing the interplay between semantic and episodic memories in the context of compare and contrast:

6. DocVQA 📄❓🔍 - Answering questions about information contained in documents.
7. RealWorldQA 🌍❓🧠 - Answering questions about real-world scenarios using multimodal information.

## Grok:

I like that it pretags itself but it didn't go multi-modal yet - maybe next release - still havent found where I can test the Grok-1.5V aspects inside Twitter X client but there amongst my social media preferred stories about AI, Science, Art - It somehow is stronger as part of the X platform - really looking forward to this and Elon way to go on open sourcing - you do what you say you will do and this sharing of tech is appreciated.

@grok
To create a diagram model for your new 7-agent stack for a new AI workflow, follow these steps:

Open a drawing or diagramming tool (e.g., Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, or draw.io).
Create a new document and set the page orientation to landscape.
In the center of the page, create a circle labeled "Multimodal AI Workflow."
Draw 7 smaller circles around the central circle, one for each agent in the stack.
Label each of the 7 smaller circles with the corresponding agent name (e.g., MMMU, Mathvista, AI2D, TextVQA, ChartQA, DocVQA, RealWorldQA).
Connect each of the 7 smaller circles to the central circle with a line.
Add a brief description of each agent's function next to its corresponding circle (e.g., "Multimodal multitask understanding of the world through various data types and tasks" for MMMU).
Add arrows between the agents to represent the flow of information and interaction between them. For example, you can have arrows from AI2D to RealWorldQA and from RealWorldQA to DocVQA, indicating that AI2D generates image descriptions that can be used by RealWorldQA to answer questions about real-world scenarios, which in turn can be used by DocVQA to answer questions about information in documents.
Review the diagram and make any necessary adjustments to ensure it accurately represents your AI workflow.
Save and export the diagram as a PDF or image file for sharing and future reference.

In this 7-agent AI workflow diagram:

Multimodal content is input into the MMMU agent for multitask understanding of various data types.
The output from MMMU is passed to Mathvista for mathematical problem-solving using visual and textual information.
AI2D then generates detailed image descriptions and captions based on the processed data.
TextVQA uses the generated captions and descriptions to answer questions about the images.
ChartQA focuses on answering questions related to data presented in charts and graphs within the content.
DocVQA handles questions about information contained in the documents.
RealWorldQA takes all the processed information and answers questions about real-world scenarios related to the content.
The result is a coherent understanding of the multimodal content, enabling the AI system to provide comprehensive answers and insights based on the various data types and modalities present in the input.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step to create a Streamlit app that allows users to explore the methods from these AI research papers on video apps:

First, I'll go through each paper and extract the key methods, algorithms and variables that could be implemented as interactive parameters in the app. I'll organize these by paper:

"Did You Hear That?" Learning to Play Video Games from Audio Cues
Method: Expand Video Game Description Language (VGDL) to specify audio
Use General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework to create audio games
Algorithm: Simple Q-Learning agents using only audio observations
General Video Game AI: Learning from Screen Capture
Method: Use screen capture as input for learning agent
Algorithm: Deep Q-Network to learn to play different games
Parameters: Different game categories and difficulty levels
AI-Generated Content (AIGC) for Various Data Modalities: A Survey
Covers AIGC methods for various data types: image, video, text, 3D shapes, scenes, avatars, motion, audio
Both single-modality and cross-modality methods (e.g. text-to-image, text-to-video)
Compares datasets and results across modalities
Detection of GAN-synthesized street videos
Method: Detect DeepStreets videos (AI-generated driving videos)
Algorithm: Simple frame-based detector
Evaluates performance on compressed videos with mismatched train/test compression
General Video Game AI: a Multi-Track Framework for Evaluating Agents, Games and Content Generation Algorithms
Uses Video Game Description Language (VGDL) to specify games
GVGAI competition framework for testing AI agents on multiple games
Multiple tracks: playing unknown games with/without simulations, level/rule generation
Next, I'll design the Streamlit app UI with these components:

Sidebar with buttons to select a paper 📄
For each selected paper, display key info in the main area using st.expander:
Paper title, authors, abstract
Interactive widgets for the paper's key parameters (e.g. game type, algorithm)
Code snippets of the main methods
"Run" button to execute selected algorithm with chosen parameters
Output area to display results (videos, charts, etc)
Finally, I'll implement the app:

Import libraries
Load datasets
Define Python functions for each paper's algorithms
Create sidebar with paper selection buttons
In main area, use conditional statements to show relevant UI for selected paper
Display paper info, parameter widgets, code, run button
Connect "Run" button to execute the appropriate function with selected parameters
Display output from the algorithm (e.g. game video, evaluation metrics)
In summary, the app allows the user to interactively explore the AI video methods from the selected research papers, with informative displays and executable code. The modular design makes it easy to add new papers and techniques.

The key papers used were: "Did You Hear That?" Learning to Play Video Games from Audio Cues, General Video Game AI: Learning from Screen Capture, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) for Various Data Modalities: A Survey, Detection of GAN-synthesized street videos, and General Video Game AI: a Multi-Track Framework for Evaluating Agents, Games and Content Generation Algorithms. Let me know if you would like me to proceed with implementing this!

*Raluca D. Gaina, Matthew Stephenson* 

  Game-playing AI research has focused for a long time on learning to play
video games from visual input or symbolic information. However, humans benefit
from a wider array of sensors which we utilise in order to navigate the world
around us. In particular, sounds and music are key to how many of us perceive
the world and influence the decisions we make. In this paper, we present
initial experiments on game-playing agents learning to play video games solely
from audio cues. We expand the Video Game Description Language to allow for
audio specification, and the General Video Game AI framework to provide new
audio games and an API for learning agents to make use of audio observations.
We analyse the games and the audio game design process, include initial results
with simple Q~Learning agents, and encourage further research in this area.

  General Video Game Artificial Intelligence is a general game playing
framework for Artificial General Intelligence research in the video-games
domain. In this paper, we propose for the first time a screen capture learning
agent for General Video Game AI framework. A Deep Q-Network algorithm was
applied and improved to develop an agent capable of learning to play different
games in the framework. After testing this algorithm using various games of
different categories and difficulty levels, the results suggest that our
proposed screen capture learning agent has the potential to learn many
different games using only a single learning algorithm.

  With the continuous increase of internet usage in todays time, everyone is
influenced by this source of the power of technology. Due to this, the rise of
applications and games Is unstoppable. A major percentage of our population
uses these applications for multiple purposes. These range from education,
communication, news, entertainment, and many more. Out of this, the application
that is making sure that the world stays in touch with each other and with
current affairs is social media. Social media applications have seen a boom in
the last 10 years with the introduction of smartphones and the internet being
available at affordable prices. Applications like Twitch and Youtube are some
of the best platforms for producing content and expressing their talent as
well. It is the goal of every content creator to post the best and most
reliable content so that they can gain recognition. It is important to know the
methods of achieving popularity easily, which is what this paper proposes to
bring to the spotlight. There should be certain parameters based on which the
reach of content could be multiplied by a good factor. The proposed research
work aims to identify and estimate the reach, popularity, and views of a
YouTube video by using certain features using machine learning and AI
techniques. A ranking system would also be used keeping the trending videos in
consideration. This would eventually help the content creator know how
authentic their content is and healthy competition to make better content
before uploading the video on the platform will be ensured.

have been attracting lots of attention recently, and AIGC methods have been
developed for various data modalities, such as image, video, text, 3D shape (as
voxels, point clouds, meshes, and neural implicit fields), 3D scene, 3D human
avatar (body and head), 3D motion, and audio -- each presenting different
characteristics and challenges. Furthermore, there have also been many
significant developments in cross-modality AIGC methods, where generative
methods can receive conditioning input in one modality and produce outputs in
another. Examples include going from various modalities to image, video, 3D
shape, 3D scene, 3D avatar (body and head), 3D motion (skeleton and avatar),
and audio modalities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of AIGC
methods across different data modalities, including both single-modality and
cross-modality methods, highlighting the various challenges, representative
works, and recent technical directions in each setting. We also survey the
representative datasets throughout the modalities, and present comparative
results for various modalities. Moreover, we also discuss the challenges and
potential future research directions.

  This paper reviews the field of Game AI, which not only deals with creating
agents that can play a certain game, but also with areas as diverse as creating
game content automatically, game analytics, or player modelling. While Game AI
was for a long time not very well recognized by the larger scientific
community, it has established itself as a research area for developing and
testing the most advanced forms of AI algorithms and articles covering advances
in mastering video games such as StarCraft 2 and Quake III appear in the most
prestigious journals. Because of the growth of the field, a single review
cannot cover it completely. Therefore, we put a focus on important recent
developments, including that advances in Game AI are starting to be extended to
areas outside of games, such as robotics or the synthesis of chemicals. In this
article, we review the algorithms and methods that have paved the way for these
breakthroughs, report on the other important areas of Game AI research, and
also point out exciting directions for the future of Game AI.

  General Video Game Playing (GVGP) aims at designing an agent that is capable
of playing multiple video games with no human intervention. In 2014, The
General Video Game AI (GVGAI) competition framework was created and released
with the purpose of providing researchers a common open-source and easy to use
platform for testing their AI methods with potentially infinity of games
created using Video Game Description Language (VGDL). The framework has been
expanded into several tracks during the last few years to meet the demand of
different research directions. The agents are required either to play multiple
unknown games with or without access to game simulations, or to design new game
levels or rules. This survey paper presents the VGDL, the GVGAI framework,
existing tracks, and reviews the wide use of GVGAI framework in research,
education and competitions five years after its birth. A future plan of
framework improvements is also described.

*Omran Alamayreh and Mauro Barni* 

  Research on the detection of AI-generated videos has focused almost
exclusively on face videos, usually referred to as deepfakes. Manipulations
like face swapping, face reenactment and expression manipulation have been the
subject of an intense research with the development of a number of efficient
tools to distinguish artificial videos from genuine ones. Much less attention
has been paid to the detection of artificial non-facial videos. Yet, new tools
for the generation of such kind of videos are being developed at a fast pace
and will soon reach the quality level of deepfake videos. The goal of this
paper is to investigate the detectability of a new kind of AI-generated videos
framing driving street sequences (here referred to as DeepStreets videos),
which, by their nature, can not be analysed with the same tools used for facial
deepfakes. Specifically, we present a simple frame-based detector, achieving
very good performance on state-of-the-art DeepStreets videos generated by the
Vid2vid architecture. Noticeably, the detector retains very good performance on
compressed videos, even when the compression level used during training does
not match that used for the test videos.

  Recent years have witnessed an astonishing explosion in the evolution of
mobile applications powered by AI technologies. The rapid growth of AI
frameworks enables the transition of AI technologies to mobile devices,
significantly prompting the adoption of AI apps (i.e., apps that integrate AI
into their functions) among smartphone devices. In this paper, we conduct the
most extensive empirical study on 56,682 published AI apps from three
perspectives: dataset characteristics, development issues, and user feedback
and privacy. To this end, we build an automated AI app identification tool, AI
Discriminator, that detects eligible AI apps from 7,259,232 mobile apps. First,
we carry out a dataset analysis, where we explore the AndroZoo large repository
to identify AI apps and their core characteristics. Subsequently, we pinpoint
key issues in AI app development (e.g., model protection). Finally, we focus on
user reviews and user privacy protection. Our paper provides several notable
findings. Some essential ones involve revealing the issue of insufficient model
protection by presenting the lack of model encryption, and demonstrating the
risk of user privacy data being leaked. We published our large-scale AI app
datasets to inspire more future research.

  With the advancement of deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI) has made
many breakthroughs in recent years and achieved superhuman performance in
various tasks such as object detection, reading comprehension, and video games.
Generative Modeling, such as various Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
models, has been applied to generate paintings and music. Research in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) also had a leap forward in 2018 since the release of
the pre-trained contextual neural language models such as BERT and recently
released GPT3. Despite the exciting AI applications aforementioned, AI is still
significantly lagging behind humans in creativity, which is often considered
the ultimate moonshot for AI. Our work is inspired by Chinese calligraphy,
which is a unique form of visual art where the character itself is an aesthetic
painting. We also draw inspirations from paintings of the Abstract
Expressionist movement in the 1940s and 1950s, such as the work by American
painter Franz Kline. In this paper, we present a creative framework based on
Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks and Contextual Neural Language
Model to generate abstract artworks that have intrinsic meaning and aesthetic
value, which is different from the existing work, such as image captioning and
text-to-image generation, where the texts are the descriptions of the images.
In addition, we have publicly released a Chinese calligraphy image dataset and
demonstrate our framework using a prototype system and a user study.

  In general, video games not only prevail in entertainment but also have
become an alternative methodology for knowledge learning, skill acquisition and
assistance for medical treatment as well as health care in education,
vocational/military training and medicine. On the other hand, video games also
provide an ideal test bed for AI researches. To a large extent, however, video
game development is still a laborious yet costly process, and there are many
technical challenges ranging from game generation to intelligent agent
creation. Unlike traditional methodologies, in Machine Learning and Perception
Lab at the University of Manchester (MLP@UoM), we advocate applying machine
learning to different tasks in video game development to address several
challenges systematically. In this paper, we overview the main progress made in
MLP@UoM recently and have an outlook on the future research directions in
learning-based video game development arising from our works.

  Due to the widespread use of smartphones with high-quality digital cameras
and easy access to a wide range of software apps for recording, editing, and
sharing videos and images, as well as the deep learning AI platforms, a new
phenomenon of 'faking' videos has emerged. Deepfake algorithms can create fake
images and videos that are virtually indistinguishable from authentic ones.
Therefore, technologies that can detect and assess the integrity of digital
visual media are crucial. Deepfakes, also known as deep learning-based fake
videos, have become a major concern in recent years due to their ability to
manipulate and alter images and videos in a way that is virtually
indistinguishable from the original. These deepfake videos can be used for
malicious purposes such as spreading misinformation, impersonating individuals,
and creating fake news. Deepfake detection technologies use various approaches
such as facial recognition, motion analysis, and audio-visual synchronization
to identify and flag fake videos. However, the rapid advancement of deepfake
technologies has made it increasingly difficult to detect these videos with
high accuracy. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the
current state of deepfake creation and detection technologies. We examine the
various deep learning-based approaches used for creating deepfakes, as well as
the techniques used for detecting them. Additionally, we analyze the
limitations and challenges of current deepfake detection methods and discuss
future research directions in this field. Overall, the paper highlights the
importance of continued research and development in deepfake detection
technologies in order to combat the negative impact of deepfakes on society and
ensure the integrity of digital visual media.

*Daniel Leiker, Ashley Ricker Gyllen, Ismail Eldesouky, Mutlu Cukurova* 

  Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have captured
worldwide attention. Tools such as Dalle-2 and ChatGPT suggest that tasks
previously thought to be beyond the capabilities of AI may now augment the
productivity of creative media in various new ways, including through the
generation of synthetic video. This research paper explores the utility of
using AI-generated synthetic video to create viable educational content for
online educational settings. To date, there is limited research investigating
the real-world educational value of AI-generated synthetic media. To address
this gap, we examined the impact of using AI-generated synthetic video in an
online learning platform on both learners content acquisition and learning
experience. We took a mixed-method approach, randomly assigning adult learners
(n=83) into one of two micro-learning conditions, collecting pre- and
post-learning assessments, and surveying participants on their learning
experience. The control condition included a traditionally produced instructor
video, while the experimental condition included a synthetic video with a
realistic AI-generated character. The results show that learners in both
conditions demonstrated significant improvement from pre- to post-learning
(p<.001), with no significant differences in gains between the two conditions
(p=.80). In addition, no differences were observed in how learners perceived
the traditional and synthetic videos. These findings suggest that AI-generated
synthetic learning videos have the potential to be a viable substitute for
videos produced via traditional methods in online educational settings, making
high quality educational content more accessible across the globe.

demuxing capabilities can now additionally analyze the video content based on
AI models. The plugins are thread optimized for best performance overcoming
certain FFmpeg threading limitations. The plugins utilize the Intel OpenVINO
Toolkit inference engine as the backend. The analytics workloads are
accelerated on different platforms such as CPU, GPU, FPGA or specialized

*Jiafei Duan, Samson Yu, Hui Li Tan, Hongyuan Zhu and Cheston Tan* 

  There has been an emerging paradigm shift from the era of "internet AI" to
"embodied AI", where AI algorithms and agents no longer learn from datasets of
images, videos or text curated primarily from the internet. Instead, they learn
through interactions with their environments from an egocentric perception
similar to humans. Consequently, there has been substantial growth in the
demand for embodied AI simulators to support various embodied AI research
tasks. This growing interest in embodied AI is beneficial to the greater
pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), but there has not been a
contemporary and comprehensive survey of this field. This paper aims to provide
an encyclopedic survey for the field of embodied AI, from its simulators to its
research. By evaluating nine current embodied AI simulators with our proposed
seven features, this paper aims to understand the simulators in their provision
for use in embodied AI research and their limitations. Lastly, this paper
surveys the three main research tasks in embodied AI -- visual exploration,
visual navigation and embodied question answering (QA), covering the
state-of-the-art approaches, evaluation metrics and datasets. Finally, with the
new insights revealed through surveying the field, the paper will provide
suggestions for simulator-for-task selections and recommendations for the
future directions of the field.

organizations needing to search, analyze and exploit video at scale. With rapid
growth in machine learning technology, the maturity of machine transcription,
machine translation, topic tagging, and object recognition tasks are improving
at an exponential rate, breaking performance records in speed and accuracy as
new applications evolve. Each section of this paper reviews and compares

  The burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is
witnessing rapid advancements, particularly in video generation. This paper
introduces AIGCBench, a pioneering comprehensive and scalable benchmark
designed to evaluate a variety of video generation tasks, with a primary focus
on Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. AIGCBench tackles the limitations of
existing benchmarks, which suffer from a lack of diverse datasets, by including
a varied and open-domain image-text dataset that evaluates different
state-of-the-art algorithms under equivalent conditions. We employ a novel text
combiner and GPT-4 to create rich text prompts, which are then used to generate
images via advanced Text-to-Image models. To establish a unified evaluation
framework for video generation tasks, our benchmark includes 11 metrics
spanning four dimensions to assess algorithm performance. These dimensions are
control-video alignment, motion effects, temporal consistency, and video
quality. These metrics are both reference video-dependent and video-free,
ensuring a comprehensive evaluation strategy. The evaluation standard proposed
correlates well with human judgment, providing insights into the strengths and
weaknesses of current I2V algorithms. The findings from our extensive
experiments aim to stimulate further research and development in the I2V field.
AIGCBench represents a significant step toward creating standardized benchmarks
for the broader AIGC landscape, proposing an adaptable and equitable framework
for future assessments of video generation tasks. We have open-sourced the
dataset and evaluation code on the project website:

  In recent years, Game AI research has made important breakthroughs using
Reinforcement Learning (RL). Despite this, RL for modern tabletop games has
gained little to no attention, even when they offer a range of unique
challenges compared to video games. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyTAG, a
Python API for interacting with the Tabletop Games framework (TAG). TAG
contains a growing set of more than 20 modern tabletop games, with a common API
for AI agents. We present techniques for training RL agents in these games and
introduce baseline results after training Proximal Policy Optimisation
algorithms on a subset of games. Finally, we discuss the unique challenges
complex modern tabletop games provide, now open to RL research through PyTAG.

 Abstract:   Game-playing AI research has focused for a long time on learning to play
video games from visual input or symbolic information. However, humans benefit
from a wider array of sensors which we utilise in order to navigate the world
around us. In particular, sounds and music are key to how many of us perceive

applications and games Is unstoppable. A major percentage of our population
uses these applications for multiple purposes. These range from education,
communication, news, entertainment, and many more. Out of this, the application
that is making sure that the world stays in touch with each other and with
current affairs is social media. Social media applications have seen a boom in
the last 10 years with the introduction of smartphones and the internet being
available at affordable prices. Applications like Twitch and Youtube are some
of the best platforms for producing content and expressing their talent as
well. It is the goal of every content creator to post the best and most
reliable content so that they can gain recognition. It is important to know the
methods of achieving popularity easily, which is what this paper proposes to
bring to the spotlight. There should be certain parameters based on which the
reach of content could be multiplied by a good factor. The proposed research
work aims to identify and estimate the reach, popularity, and views of a
YouTube video by using certain features using machine learning and AI
techniques. A ranking system would also be used keeping the trending videos in
consideration. This would eventually help the content creator know how
authentic their content is and healthy competition to make better content
before uploading the video on the platform will be ensured.

review 76 papers published between 2022 to early 2024 on LLMs and video games,
with key focus areas in game AI, game development, narrative, and game research
and reviews. Our paper provides an early state of the field and lays the

What is Semantic and Episodic Memory
('# 🩺🔍 Search Results ### 08 Jun 2022 | [SYNERgy between SYNaptic consolidation and Experience Replay for general continual learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04016v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04016v1) *Fahad Sarfraz, Elahe Arani, Bahram Zonooz*   Continual learning (CL) in the brain is facilitated by a complex set of mechanisms. This includes the interplay of multiple memory systems for consolidating information as posited by the complementary learning systems (CLS) theory and synaptic consolidation for protecting the acquired knowledge from erasure. Thus, we propose a general CL method that creates a synergy between SYNaptic consolidation and dual memory Experience Replay (SYNERgy). Our method maintains a semantic memory that accumulates and consolidates information across the tasks and interacts with the episodic memory for effective replay. It further employs synaptic consolidation by tracking the importance of parameters during the training trajectory and anchoring them to the consolidated parameters in the semantic memory. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to employ dual memory experience replay in conjunction with synaptic consolidation that is suitable for general CL whereby the network does not utilize task boundaries or task labels during training or inference. Our evaluation on various challenging CL scenarios and characteristics analyses demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating both synaptic consolidation and CLS theory in enabling effective CL in DNNs.  ---------------  ### 07 Feb 2022 | [Kanerva++: extending The Kanerva Machine with differentiable, locally block allocated latent memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03905v3) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03905v3) *Jason Ramapuram, Yan Wu, Alexandros Kalousis*   Episodic and semantic memory are critical components of the human memory model. The theory of complementary learning systems (McClelland et al., 1995) suggests that the compressed representation produced by a serial event (episodic memory) is later restructured to build a more generalized form of reusable knowledge (semantic memory). In this work we develop a new principled Bayesian memory allocation scheme that bridges the gap between episodic and semantic memory via a hierarchical latent variable model. We take inspiration from traditional heap allocation and extend the idea of locally contiguous memory to the Kanerva Machine, enabling a novel differentiable block allocated latent memory. In contrast to the Kanerva Machine, we simplify the process of memory writing by treating it as a fully feed forward deterministic process, relying on the stochasticity of the read key distribution to disperse information within the memory. We demonstrate that this allocation scheme improves performance in memory conditional image generation, resulting in new state-of-the-art conditional likelihood values on binarized MNIST (<=41.58 nats/image) , binarized Omniglot (<=66.24 nats/image), as well as presenting competitive performance on CIFAR10, DMLab Mazes, Celeb-A and ImageNet32x32.  ---------------  ### 17 Feb 2021 | [End-to-End Egospheric Spatial Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07764v2) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07764v2) *Daniel Lenton, Stephen James, Ronald Clark, Andrew J. Davison*   Spatial memory, or the ability to remember and recall specific locations and objects, is central to autonomous agents\' ability to carry out tasks in real environments. However, most existing artificial memory modules are not very adept at storing spatial information. We propose a parameter-free module, Egospheric Spatial Memory (ESM), which encodes the memory in an ego-sphere around the agent, enabling expressive 3D representations. ESM can be trained end-to-end via either imitation or reinforcement learning, and improves both training efficiency and final performance against other memory baselines on both drone and manipulator visuomotor control tasks. The explicit egocentric geometry also enables us to seamlessly combine the learned controller with other non-learned modalities, such as local obstacle avoidance. We further show applications to semantic segmentation on the ScanNet dataset, where ESM naturally combines image-level and map-level inference modalities. Through our broad set of experiments, we show that ESM provides a general computation graph for embodied spatial reasoning, and the module forms a bridge between real-time mapping systems and differentiable memory architectures.

Chang, Manolis Savva*   Navigation tasks in photorealistic 3D environments are challenging because they require perception and effective planning under partial observability. Recent work shows that map-like memory is useful for long-horizon navigation tasks. However, a focused investigation of the impact of maps on navigation tasks of varying complexity has not yet been performed. We propose the multiON task, which requires navigation to an episode-specific sequence of objects in a realistic environment. MultiON generalizes the ObjectGoal navigation task and explicitly tests the ability of navigation agents to locate previously observed goal objects. We perform a set of multiON experiments to examine how a variety of agent models perform across a spectrum of navigation task complexities. Our experiments show that: i) navigation performance degrades dramatically with escalating task complexity; ii) a simple semantic map agent performs surprisingly well relative to more complex neural image feature map agents; and iii) even oracle map agents achieve relatively low performance, indicating the potential for future work in training embodied navigation agents using maps.

In computer vision, however, there has been relatively little exploration of hard attention, where some information is selectively ignored, in spite of the success of soft attention, where information is re-weighted and aggregated, but never filtered out. Here, we introduce a new approach for hard attention and find it achieves very competitive performance on a recently-released visual question answering datasets, equalling and in some cases surpassing similar soft attention architectures while entirely ignoring some features. Even though the hard attention mechanism is thought to be non-differentiable, we found that the feature magnitudes correlate with semantic relevance, and provide a useful signal for our mechanism\'s attentional selection criterion. Because hard attention selects important features of the input information, it can also be more efficient than analogous soft attention mechanisms. This is especially important for recent approaches that use non-local pairwise operations, whereby computational and memory costs are quadratic in the size of the set of features.  ---------------  ### 31 May 2018 | [Following High-level Navigation Instructions on a Simulated Quadcopter with Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00047v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00047v1) *Valts Blukis, Nataly Brukhim, Andrew Bennett, Ross A. Knepper, Yoav Artzi*   We introduce a method for following high-level navigation instructions by mapping directly from images, instructions and pose estimates to continuous low-level velocity commands for real-time control. The Grounded Semantic Mapping Network (GSMN) is a fully-differentiable neural network architecture that builds an explicit semantic map in the world reference frame by incorporating a pinhole camera projection model within the network. The information stored in the map is learned from experience, while the local-to-world transformation is computed explicitly. We train the model using DAggerFM, a modified variant of DAgger that trades tabular convergence guarantees for improved training speed and memory use. We test GSMN in virtual environments on a realistic quadcopter simulator and show that incorporating an explicit mapping and grounding modules allows GSMN to outperform strong neural baselines and almost reach an expert policy performance. Finally, we analyze the learned map representations and show that using an explicit map leads to an interpretable instruction-following model.  ---------------  ### 20 Oct 2016 | [A Growing Long-term Episodic & Semantic Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06402v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06402v1) *Marc Pickett, Rami Al-Rfou, Louis Shao, Chris Tar*   The long-term memory of most connectionist systems lies entirely in the weights of the system. Since the number of weights is typically fixed, this bounds the total amount of knowledge that can be learned and stored. Though this is not normally a problem for a neural network designed for a specific task, such a bound is undesirable for a system that continually learns over an open range of domains. To address this, we describe a lifelong learning system that leverages a fast, though non-differentiable, content-addressable memory which can be exploited to encode both a long history of sequential episodic knowledge and semantic knowledge over many episodes for an unbounded number of domains. This opens the door for investigation into transfer learning, and leveraging prior knowledge that has been learned over a lifetime of experiences to new domains.  ---------------  ### 31 May 2015 | [Recurrent Neural Networks with External Memory for Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00195v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00195v1) *Baolin Peng, Kaisheng Yao*   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular for the task of language understanding. In this task, a semantic tagger is deployed to associate a semantic label to each word in an input sequence. The success of RNN may be attributed to its ability to memorize long-term dependence that relates the current-time semantic label prediction to the observations many time instances away. However, the memory capacity of simple RNNs is limited because of the gradient vanishing and exploding problem. We propose to use an external memory to improve memorization capability of RNNs. We conducted experiments on the ATIS dataset, and observed that the proposed model was able to achieve the state-of-the-art results. We compare our proposed model with alternative models and report analysis results that may provide insights for future research.  ---------------  ### 15 May 2023 | [Analyzing Deep Learning Representations of Point Clouds for Real-Time In-Vehicle LiDAR Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14612v3) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14612v3) *Marc Uecker, Tobias Fleck, Marcel Pflugfelder, J. Marius Zöllner*   LiDAR sensors are an integral part of modern autonomous vehicles as they provide an accurate, high-resolution 3D representation of the vehicle\'s surroundings. However, it is computationally difficult to make use of the ever-increasing amounts of data from multiple high-resolution LiDAR sensors. As frame-rates, point cloud sizes and sensor resolutions increase, real-time processing of these point clouds must still extract semantics from this increasingly precise picture of the vehicle\'s environment. One deciding factor of the run-time performance and accuracy of deep neural networks operating on these point clouds is the underlying data representation and the way it is computed. In this work, we examine the relationship between the computational representations used in neural networks and their performance characteristics. To this end, we propose a novel computational taxonomy of LiDAR point cloud representations used in modern deep neural networks for 3D point cloud processing. Using this taxonomy, we perform a structured analysis of different families of approaches. Thereby, we uncover common advantages and limitations in terms of computational efficiency, memory requirements, and representational capacity as measured by semantic segmentation performance. Finally, we provide some insights and guidance for future developments in neural point cloud processing methods.  ---------------  ### 28 Dec 2022 | [Sparse Coding in a Dual Memory System for Lifelong Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05058v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05058v1) *Fahad Sarfraz, Elahe Arani, Bahram Zonooz*   Efficient continual learning in humans is enabled by a rich set of neurophysiological mechanisms and interactions between multiple memory systems. The brain efficiently encodes information in non-overlapping sparse codes, which facilitates the learning of new associations faster with controlled interference with previous associations. To mimic sparse coding in DNNs, we enforce activation sparsity along with a dropout mechanism which encourages the model to activate similar units for semantically similar inputs and have less overlap with activation patterns of semantically dissimilar inputs. This provides us with an efficient mechanism for balancing the reusability and interference of features, depending on the similarity of classes across tasks. Furthermore, we employ sparse coding in a multiple-memory replay mechanism. Our method maintains an additional long-term semantic memory that aggregates and consolidates information encoded in the synaptic weights of the working model. Our extensive evaluation and characteristics analysis show that equipped with these biologically inspired mechanisms, the model can further mitigate forgetting.  ---------------  ### 21 Jan 2016 | [Neural Enquirer: Learning to Query Tables with Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00965v2) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00965v2) *Pengcheng Yin, Zhengdong Lu, Hang Li, Ben Kao*   We proposed Neural Enquirer as a neural network architecture to execute a natural language (NL) query on a knowledge-base (KB) for answers. Basically, Neural Enquirer finds the distributed representation of a query and then executes it on knowledge-base tables to obtain the answer as one of the values in the tables. Unlike similar efforts in end-to-end training of semantic parsers, Neural Enquirer is fully "neuralized": it not only gives distributional representation of the query and the knowledge-base, but also realizes the execution of compositional queries as a series of differentiable operations, with intermediate results (consisting of annotations of the tables at different levels) saved on multiple layers of memory. Neural Enquirer can be trained with gradient descent, with which not only the parameters of the controlling components and semantic parsing component, but also the embeddings of the tables and query words can be learned from scratch. The training can be done in an end-to-end fashion, but it can take stronger guidance, e.g., the step-by-step supervision for complicated queries, and benefit from it. Neural Enquirer is one step towards building neural network systems which seek to understand language by executing it on real-world. Our experiments show that Neural Enquirer can learn to execute fairly complicated NL queries on tables with rich structures.  ---------------  ### 17 May 2016 | [Sentence Pair Scoring: Towards Unified Framework for Text Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06127v4) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06127v4) *Petr Baudiš, Jan Pichl, Tomáš Vyskočil, Jan Šedivý*   We review the task of Sentence Pair Scoring, popular in the literature in various forms - viewed as Answer Sentence Selection, Semantic Text Scoring, Next Utterance Ranking, Recognizing Textual Entailment, Paraphrasing or e.g. a component of Memory Networks.   We argue that all such tasks are similar from the model perspective and propose new baselines by comparing the performance of common IR metrics and popular convolutional, recurrent and attention-based neural models across many Sentence Pair Scoring tasks and datasets. We discuss the problem of evaluating randomized models, propose a statistically grounded methodology, and attempt to improve comparisons by releasing new datasets that are much harder than some of the currently used well explored benchmarks. We introduce a unified open source software framework with easily pluggable models and tasks, which enables us to experiment with multi-task reusability of trained sentence model. We set a new state-of-art in performance on the Ubuntu Dialogue dataset.  ---------------  ### 05 Oct 2021 | [A Survey On Neural Word Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01804v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01804v1) *Erhan Sezerer, Selma Tekir*   Understanding human language has been a sub-challenge on the way of intelligent machines. The study of meaning in natural language processing (NLP) relies on the distributional hypothesis where language elements get meaning from the words that co-occur within contexts. The revolutionary idea of distributed representation for a concept is close to the working of a human mind in that the meaning of a word is spread across several neurons, and a loss of activation will only slightly affect the memory retrieval process.   Neural word embeddings transformed the whole field of NLP by introducing substantial improvements in all NLP tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive literature review on neural word embeddings. We give theoretical foundations and describe existing work by an interplay between word embeddings and language modelling. We provide broad coverage on neural word embeddings, including early word embeddings, embeddings targeting specific semantic relations, sense embeddings, morpheme embeddings, and finally, contextual representations. Finally, we describe benchmark datasets in word embeddings\' performance evaluation and downstream tasks along with the performance results of/due to word embeddings.  ---------------  ### 16 Jan 2019 | [Memory Augmented Deep Generative models for Forecasting the Next Shot Location in Tennis](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05123v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05123v1) *Tharindu Fernando, Simon Denman, Sridha Sridharan, Clinton Fookes*   This paper presents a novel framework for predicting shot location and type in tennis. Inspired by recent neuroscience discoveries we incorporate neural memory modules to model the episodic and semantic memory components of a tennis player. We propose a Semi Supervised Generative Adversarial Network architecture that couples these memory models with the automatic feature learning power of deep neural networks and demonstrate methodologies for learning player level behavioural patterns with the proposed framework. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model on tennis tracking data from the 2012 Australian Tennis open and exhibit applications of the proposed method in discovering how players adapt their style depending on the match context.  ---------------  ### 06 Dec 2023 | [Wake-Sleep Consolidated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08623v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08623v1) *Amelia Sorrenti, Giovanni Bellitto, Federica Proietto Salanitri, Matteo Pennisi, Simone Palazzo, Concetto Spampinato*   We propose Wake-Sleep Consolidated Learning (WSCL), a learning strategy leveraging Complementary Learning System theory and the wake-sleep phases of the human brain to improve the performance of deep neural networks for visual classification tasks in continual learning settings. Our method learns continually via the synchronization between distinct wake and sleep phases. During the wake phase, the model is exposed to sensory input and adapts its representations, ensuring stability through a dynamic parameter freezing mechanism and storing episodic memories in a short-term temporary memory (similarly to what happens in the hippocampus). During the sleep phase, the training process is split into NREM and REM stages. In the NREM stage, the model\'s synaptic weights are consolidated using replayed samples from the short-term and long-term memory and the synaptic plasticity mechanism is activated, strengthening important connections and weakening unimportant ones. In the REM stage, the model is exposed to previously-unseen realistic visual sensory experience, and the dreaming process is activated, which enables the model to explore the potential feature space, thus preparing synapses to future knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet and FG-ImageNet. In all cases, our method outperforms the baselines and prior work, yielding a significant performance gain on continual visual classification tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of all processing stages and the importance of dreaming to enable positive forward transfer.  ---------------  ### 06 Oct 2016 | [A New Data Representation Based on Training Data Characteristics to Extract Drug Named-Entity in Medical Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01891v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.01891v1) *Sadikin Mujiono, Mohamad Ivan Fanany, Chan Basaruddin*   One essential task in information extraction from the medical corpus is drug name recognition. Compared with text sources come from other domains, the medical text is special and has unique characteristics. In addition, the medical text mining poses more challenges, e.g., more unstructured text, the fast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same drug. The mining is even more challenging due to the lack of labeled dataset sources and external knowledge, as well as multiple token representations for a single drug name that is more common in the real application setting. Although many approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems remained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75). This paper presents a new treatment in data representation techniques to overcome some of those challenges. We propose three data representation techniques based on the characteristics of word distribution and word similarities as a result of word embedding training. The first technique is evaluated with the standard NN model, i.e., MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptrons). The second technique involves two deep network classifiers, i.e., DBN (Deep Belief Networks), and SAE (Stacked Denoising Encoders). The third technique represents the sentence as a sequence that is evaluated with a recurrent NN model, i.e., LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). In extracting the drug name entities, the third technique gives the best F-score performance compared to the state of the art, with its average F-score being 0.8645.  ---------------  ### 07 May 2016 | [Learning with Memory Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07972v9) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.07972v9) *Volker Tresp, Cristóbal Esteban, Yinchong Yang, Stephan Baier, Denis Krompaß*   Embedding learning, a.k.a. representation learning, has been shown to be able to model large-scale semantic knowledge graphs. A key concept is a mapping of the knowledge graph to a tensor representation whose entries are predicted by models using latent representations of generalized entities. Latent variable models are well suited to deal with the high dimensionality and sparsity of typical knowledge graphs. In recent publications the embedding models were extended to also consider time evolutions, time patterns and subsymbolic representations. In this paper we map embedding models, which were developed purely as solutions to technical problems for modelling temporal knowledge graphs, to various cognitive memory functions, in particular to semantic and concept memory, episodic memory, sensory memory, short-term memory, and working memory. We discuss learning, query answering, the path from sensory input to semantic decoding, and the relationship between episodic memory and semantic memory. We introduce a number of hypotheses on human memory that can be derived from the developed mathematical models.  ---------------  ### 24 Mar 2022 | [Object Memory Transformer for Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14708v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14708v1) *Rui Fukushima, Kei Ota, Asako Kanezaki, Yoko Sasaki, Yusuke Yoshiyasu*   This paper presents a reinforcement learning method for object goal navigation (ObjNav) where an agent navigates in 3D indoor environments to reach a target object based on long-term observations of objects and scenes. To this end, we propose Object Memory Transformer (OMT) that consists of two key ideas: 1) Object-Scene Memory (OSM) that enables to store long-term scenes and object semantics, and 2) Transformer that attends to salient objects in the sequence of previously observed scenes and objects stored in OSM. This mechanism allows the agent to efficiently navigate in the indoor environment without prior knowledge about the environments, such as topological maps or 3D meshes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses a long-term memory of object semantics in a goal-oriented navigation task. Experimental results conducted on the AI2-THOR dataset show that OMT outperforms previous approaches in navigating in unknown environments. In particular, we show that utilizing the long-term object semantics information improves the efficiency of navigation.  ---------------  ### 24 Sep 2021 | [CLIPort: What and Where Pathways for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12098v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12098v1) *Mohit Shridhar, Lucas Manuelli, Dieter Fox*   How can we imbue robots with the ability to manipulate objects precisely but also to reason about them in terms of abstract concepts? Recent works in manipulation have shown that end-to-end networks can learn dexterous skills that require precise spatial reasoning, but these methods often fail to generalize to new goals or quickly learn transferable concepts across tasks. In parallel, there has been great progress in learning generalizable semantic representations for vision and language by training on large-scale internet data, however these representations lack the spatial understanding necessary for fine-grained manipulation. To this end, we propose a framework that combines the best of both worlds: a two-stream architecture with semantic and spatial pathways for vision-based manipulation. Specifically, we present CLIPort, a language-conditioned imitation-learning agent that combines the broad semantic understanding (what) of CLIP [1] with the spatial precision (where) of Transporter [2]. Our end-to-end framework is capable of solving a variety of language-specified tabletop tasks from packing unseen objects to folding cloths, all without any explicit representations of object poses, instance segmentations, memory, symbolic states, or syntactic structures. Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that our approach is data efficient in few-shot settings and generalizes effectively to seen and unseen semantic concepts. We even learn one multi-task policy for 10 simulated and 9 real-world tasks that is better or comparable to single-task policies.  ---------------  ### 17 Dec 2015 | [Listen, Attend, and Walk: Neural Mapping of Navigational Instructions to Action Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04089v4) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04089v4) *Hongyuan Mei, Mohit Bansal, Matthew R. Walter*   We propose a neural sequence-to-sequence model for direction following, a task that is essential to realizing effective autonomous agents. Our alignment-based encoder-decoder model with long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN) translates natural language instructions to action sequences based upon a representation of the observable world state. We introduce a multi-level aligner that empowers our model to focus on sentence "regions" salient to the current world state by using multiple abstractions of the input sentence. In contrast to existing methods, our model uses no specialized linguistic resources (e.g., parsers) or task-specific annotations (e.g., seed lexicons). It is therefore generalizable, yet still achieves the best results reported to-date on a benchmark single-sentence dataset and competitive results for the limited-training multi-sentence setting. We analyze our model through a series of ablations that elucidate the contributions of the primary components of our model.  ---------------', '<s>[INST] Context:  1. <b> SYNERgy between SYNaptic consolidation and Experience Replay for general continual learning </b>   Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the brain is facilitated by a complex set of mechanisms.

Since the number of weights is typically fixed, this bounds the total amount of knowledge that can be learned and stored. Though this is not normally a problem for a neural network designed for a specific task, such a bound is undesirable for a system that continually learns over an open range of domains. To address this, we describe a lifelong learning system that leverages a fast, though non-differentiable, content-addressable memory which can be exploited to encode both a long history of sequential episodic knowledge and semantic knowledge over many episodes for an unbounded number of domains. This opens the door for investigation into transfer learning, and leveraging prior knowledge that has been learned over a lifetime of experiences to new domains. 8. <b> Recurrent Neural Networks with External Memory for Language Understanding </b>   Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular for the task of language understanding. In this task, a semantic tagger is deployed to associate a semantic label to each word in an input sequence. The success of RNN may be attributed to its ability to memorize long-term dependence that relates the current-time semantic label prediction to the observations many time instances away. However, the memory capacity of simple RNNs is limited because of the gradient vanishing and exploding problem. We propose to use an external memory to improve memorization capability of RNNs. We conducted experiments on the ATIS dataset, and observed that the proposed model was able to achieve the state-of-the-art results. We compare our proposed model with alternative models and report analysis results that may provide insights for future research. 9. <b> Analyzing Deep Learning Representations of Point Clouds for Real-Time In-Vehicle LiDAR Perception </b>   Abstract: LiDAR sensors are an integral part of modern autonomous vehicles as they provide an accurate, high-resolution 3D representation of the vehicle\'s surroundings. However, it is computationally difficult to make use of the ever-increasing amounts of data from multiple high-resolution LiDAR sensors. As frame-rates, point cloud sizes and sensor resolutions increase, real-time processing of these point clouds must still extract semantics from this increasingly precise picture of the vehicle\'s environment. One deciding factor of the run-time performance and accuracy of deep neural networks operating on these point clouds is the underlying data representation and the way it is computed. In this work, we examine the relationship between the computational representations used in neural networks and their performance characteristics. To this end, we propose a novel computational taxonomy of LiDAR point cloud representations used in modern deep neural networks for 3D point cloud processing. Using this taxonomy, we perform a structured analysis of different families of approaches. Thereby, we uncover common advantages and limitations in terms of computational efficiency, memory requirements, and representational capacity as measured by semantic segmentation performance. Finally, we provide some insights and guidance for future developments in neural point cloud processing methods. 10. <b> Sparse Coding in a Dual Memory System for Lifelong Learning </b>   Abstract: Efficient continual learning in humans is enabled by a rich set of neurophysiological mechanisms and interactions between multiple memory systems. The brain efficiently encodes information in non-overlapping sparse codes, which facilitates the learning of new associations faster with controlled interference with previous associations. To mimic sparse coding in DNNs, we enforce activation sparsity along with a dropout mechanism which encourages the model to activate similar units for semantically similar inputs and have less overlap with activation patterns of semantically dissimilar inputs. This provides us with an efficient mechanism for balancing the reusability and interference of features, depending on the similarity of classes across tasks. Furthermore, we employ sparse coding in a multiple-memory replay mechanism. Our method maintains an additional long-term semantic memory that aggregates and consolidates information encoded in the synaptic weights of the working model. Our extensive evaluation and characteristics analysis show that equipped with these biologically inspired mechanisms, the model can further mitigate forgetting. 11. <b> Neural Enquirer: Learning to Query Tables with Natural Language </b>   Abstract: We proposed Neural Enquirer as a neural network architecture to execute a natural language (NL) query on a knowledge-base (KB) for answers. Basically, Neural Enquirer finds the distributed representation of a query and then executes it on knowledge-base tables to obtain the answer as one of the values in the tables. Unlike similar efforts in end-to-end training of semantic parsers, Neural Enquirer is fully "neuralized": it not only gives distributional representation of the query and the knowledge-base, but also realizes the execution of compositional queries as a series of differentiable operations, with intermediate results (consisting of annotations of the tables at different levels) saved on multiple layers of memory. Neural Enquirer can be trained with gradient descent, with which not only the parameters of the controlling components and semantic parsing component, but also the embeddings of the tables and query words can be learned from scratch. The training can be done in an end-to-end fashion, but it can take stronger guidance, e.g., the step-by-step supervision for complicated queries, and benefit from it. Neural Enquirer is one step towards building neural network systems which seek to understand language by executing it on real-world. Our experiments show that Neural Enquirer can learn to execute fairly complicated NL queries on tables with rich structures. 12. <b> Sentence Pair Scoring: Towards Unified Framework for Text Comprehension </b>   Abstract: We review the task of Sentence Pair Scoring, popular in the literature in various forms - viewed as Answer Sentence Selection, Semantic Text Scoring, Next Utterance Ranking, Recognizing Textual Entailment, Paraphrasing or e.g. a component of Memory Networks.   We argue that all such tasks are similar from the model perspective and propose new baselines by comparing the performance of common IR metrics and popular convolutional, recurrent and attention-based neural models across many Sentence Pair Scoring tasks and datasets. We discuss the problem of evaluating randomized models, propose a statistically grounded methodology, and attempt to improve comparisons by releasing new datasets that are much harder than some of the currently used well explored benchmarks. We introduce a unified open source software framework with easily pluggable models and tasks, which enables us to experiment with multi-task reusability of trained sentence model. We set a new state-of-art in performance on the Ubuntu Dialogue dataset. 13. <b> A Survey On Neural Word Embeddings </b>   Abstract: Understanding human language has been a sub-challenge on the way of intelligent machines. The study of meaning in natural language processing (NLP) relies on the distributional hypothesis where language elements get meaning from the words that co-occur within contexts. The revolutionary idea of distributed representation for a concept is close to the working of a human mind in that the meaning of a word is spread across several neurons, and a loss of activation will only slightly affect the memory retrieval process.   Neural word embeddings transformed the whole field of NLP by introducing substantial improvements in all NLP tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive literature review on neural word embeddings. We give theoretical foundations and describe existing work by an interplay between word embeddings and language modelling. We provide broad coverage on neural word embeddings, including early word embeddings, embeddings targeting specific semantic relations, sense embeddings, morpheme embeddings, and finally, contextual representations. Finally, we describe benchmark datasets in word embeddings\' performance evaluation and downstream tasks along with the performance results of/due to word embeddings. 14. <b> Memory Augmented Deep Generative models for Forecasting the Next Shot Location in Tennis </b>   Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for predicting shot location and type in tennis. Inspired by recent neuroscience discoveries we incorporate neural memory modules to model the episodic and semantic memory components of a tennis player. We propose a Semi Supervised Generative Adversarial Network architecture that couples these memory models with the automatic feature learning power of deep neural networks and demonstrate methodologies for learning player level behavioural patterns with the proposed framework. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model on tennis tracking data from the 2012 Australian Tennis open and exhibit applications of the proposed method in discovering how players adapt their style depending on the match context. 15. <b> Wake-Sleep Consolidated Learning </b>   Abstract: We propose Wake-Sleep Consolidated Learning (WSCL), a learning strategy leveraging Complementary Learning System theory and the wake-sleep phases of the human brain to improve the performance of deep neural networks for visual classification tasks in continual learning settings. Our method learns continually via the synchronization between distinct wake and sleep phases. During the wake phase, the model is exposed to sensory input and adapts its representations, ensuring stability through a dynamic parameter freezing mechanism and storing episodic memories in a short-term temporary memory (similarly to what happens in the hippocampus). During the sleep phase, the training process is split into NREM and REM stages. In the NREM stage, the model\'s synaptic weights are consolidated using replayed samples from the short-term and long-term memory and the synaptic plasticity mechanism is activated, strengthening important connections and weakening unimportant ones. In the REM stage, the model is exposed to previously-unseen realistic visual sensory experience, and the dreaming process is activated, which enables the model to explore the potential feature space, thus preparing synapses to future knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet and FG-ImageNet. In all cases, our method outperforms the baselines and prior work, yielding a significant performance gain on continual visual classification tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of all processing stages and the importance of dreaming to enable positive forward transfer. 16. <b> A New Data Representation Based on Training Data Characteristics to Extract Drug Named-Entity in Medical Text </b>   Abstract: One essential task in information extraction from the medical corpus is drug name recognition. Compared with text sources come from other domains, the medical text is special and has unique characteristics. In addition, the medical text mining poses more challenges, e.g., more unstructured text, the fast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same drug. The mining is even more challenging due to the lack of labeled dataset sources and external knowledge, as well as multiple token representations for a single drug name that is more common in the real application setting. Although many approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems remained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75). This paper presents a new treatment in data representation techniques to overcome some of those challenges. We propose three data representation techniques based on the characteristics of word distribution and word similarities as a result of word embedding training. The first technique is evaluated with the standard NN model, i.e., MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptrons). The second technique involves two deep network classifiers, i.e., DBN (Deep Belief Networks), and SAE (Stacked Denoising Encoders). The third technique represents the sentence as a sequence that is evaluated with a recurrent NN model, i.e., LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). In extracting the drug name entities, the third technique gives the best F-score performance compared to the state of the art, with its average F-score being 0.8645. 17. <b> Learning with Memory Embeddings </b>   Abstract: Embedding learning, a.k.a. representation learning, has been shown to be able to model large-scale semantic knowledge graphs. A key concept is a mapping of the knowledge graph to a tensor representation whose entries are predicted by models using latent representations of generalized entities. Latent variable models are well suited to deal with the high dimensionality and sparsity of typical knowledge graphs. In recent publications the embedding models were extended to also consider time evolutions, time patterns and subsymbolic representations. In this paper we map embedding models, which were developed purely as solutions to technical problems for modelling temporal knowledge graphs, to various cognitive memory functions, in particular to semantic and concept memory, episodic memory, sensory memory, short-term memory, and working memory. We discuss learning, query answering, the path from sensory input to semantic decoding, and the relationship between episodic memory and semantic memory. We introduce a number of hypotheses on human memory that can be derived from the developed mathematical models. 18. <b> Object Memory Transformer for Object Goal Navigation </b>   Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning method for object goal navigation (ObjNav) where an agent navigates in 3D indoor environments to reach a target object based on long-term observations of objects and scenes. To this end, we propose Object Memory Transformer (OMT) that consists of two key ideas: 1) Object-Scene Memory (OSM) that enables to store long-term scenes and object semantics, and 2) Transformer that attends to salient objects in the sequence of previously observed scenes and objects stored in OSM. This mechanism allows the agent to efficiently navigate in the indoor environment without prior knowledge about the environments, such as topological maps or 3D meshes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses a long-term memory of object semantics in a goal-oriented navigation task. Experimental results conducted on the AI2-THOR dataset show that OMT outperforms previous approaches in navigating in unknown environments. In particular, we show that utilizing the long-term object semantics information improves the efficiency of navigation. 19. <b> CLIPort: What and Where Pathways for Robotic Manipulation </b>   Abstract: How can we imbue robots with the ability to manipulate objects precisely but also to reason about them in terms of abstract concepts? Recent works in manipulation have shown that end-to-end networks can learn dexterous skills that require precise spatial reasoning, but these methods often fail to generalize to new goals or quickly learn transferable concepts across tasks. In parallel, there has been great progress in learning generalizable semantic representations for vision and language by training on large-scale internet data, however these representations lack the spatial understanding necessary for fine-grained manipulation. To this end, we propose a framework that combines the best of both worlds: a two-stream architecture with semantic and spatial pathways for vision-based manipulation. Specifically, we present CLIPort, a language-conditioned imitation-learning agent that combines the broad semantic understanding (what) of CLIP [1] with the spatial precision (where) of Transporter [2]. Our end-to-end framework is capable of solving a variety of language-specified tabletop tasks from packing unseen objects to folding cloths, all without any explicit representations of object poses, instance segmentations, memory, symbolic states, or syntactic structures. Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that our approach is data efficient in few-shot settings and generalizes effectively to seen and unseen semantic concepts. We even learn one multi-task policy for 10 simulated and 9 real-world tasks that is better or comparable to single-task policies. 20. <b> Listen, Attend, and Walk: Neural Mapping of Navigational Instructions to Action Sequences </b>   Abstract: We propose a neural sequence-to-sequence model for direction following, a task that is essential to realizing effective autonomous agents. Our alignment-based encoder-decoder model with long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN) translates natural language instructions to action sequences based upon a representation of the observable world state. We introduce a multi-level aligner that empowers our model to focus on sentence "regions" salient to the current world state by using multiple abstractions of the input sentence. In contrast to existing methods, our model uses no specialized linguistic resources (e.g., parsers) or task-specific annotations (e.g., seed lexicons). It is therefore generalizable, yet still achieves the best results reported to-date on a benchmark single-sentence dataset and competitive results for the limited-training multi-sentence setting. We analyze our model through a series of ablations that elucidate the contributions of the primary components of our model.

# SMS Verify - MFA that lightens the load for remembering who you are and giving you a history

https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/RT-SMS-Phone-Verify

This SMS Message Me space is able to accept a phone number and password which allow you to receive an SMS message on your phone that also contains a link to the space you are authenticating to.  

Focus is on minimizing burden and clearly indicating rules, yet not requiring added burdensome software or diversions that distract you for more than 5 seconds.

This compared to other MFA methods is the quickest most convenient since it allows you to establish a Phone Link which is vastly more useful to track your history and also provides a way to download the history of your usage locally to your phone which ensures a reviewable security pattern that is personalized to users.

This semantic and episodic memory interface is also an assistive feature that can help those with intellectual and development disability thus seeks to minimize work while maximizing focus and communciation on task at hand.

Antipattern studies:
1. Azure auth - requires you to change your ID and use an MFA program.
2. MFA difficult in Github.
3. MFA difficulty with MS Authenticator

Pain - I keep having to login and MFA distracts me especially when it doesn't work or is locked to one device.
Joy - At run time you can choose an SMS response number, then it texts you there and stores history which you can review.  
Superpower - This allows you to keep track of your app links in SMS text and is able to jump into a flow with deep linking and query parameters and could be used for contiguous memory across apps in SMS chat history.

# SDLC in the age of AI and SaaS
top ten questions solved in last 5 years
('# 🩺🔍 Search Results\n### 04 Mar 2021 | The Transformer Network for the Traveling Salesman Problem | ⬇️\nXavier Bresson and Thomas Laurent \n\n The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the most popular and most studied\ncombinatorial problem, starting with von Neumann in 1951. It has driven the\ndiscovery of several optimization techniques such as cutting planes,\nbranch-and-bound, local search, Lagrangian relaxation, and simulated annealing.\nThe last five years have seen the emergence of promising techniques where\n(graph) neural networks have been capable to learn new combinatorial\nalgorithms. The main question is whether deep learning can learn better\nheuristics from data, i.e. replacing human-engineered heuristics? This is\nappealing because developing algorithms to tackle efficiently NP-hard problems\nmay require years of research, and many industry problems are combinatorial by\nnature. In this work, we propose to adapt the recent successful Transformer\narchitecture originally developed for natural language processing to the\ncombinatorial TSP. Training is done by reinforcement learning, hence without\nTSP training solutions, and decoding uses beam search. We report improved\nperformances over recent learned heuristics with an optimal gap of 0.004% for\nTSP50 and 0.39% for TSP100.\n\n---------------\n\n### 22 Jul 2019 | ELI5: Long Form Question Answering | ⬇️\nAngela Fan, Yacine Jernite, Ethan Perez, David Grangier, Jason Weston, Michael Auli \n\n We introduce the first large-scale corpus for long-form question answering, a\ntask requiring elaborate and in-depth answers to open-ended questions. The\ndataset comprises 270K threads from the Reddit forum Explain Like I\'m Five\'\'\n(ELI5) where an online community provides answers to questions which are\ncomprehensible by five year olds. Compared to existing datasets, ELI5 comprises\ndiverse questions requiring multi-sentence answers. We provide a large set of\nweb documents to help answer the question. Automatic and human evaluations show\nthat an abstractive model trained with a multi-task objective outperforms\nconventional Seq2Seq, language modeling, as well as a strong extractive\nbaseline. However, our best model is still far from human performance since\nraters prefer gold responses in over 86% of cases, leaving ample opportunity\nfor future improvement.\n\n---------------\n\n### 09 Jul 2023 | [Generalized Action-based Ball Recovery Model using 360$^\\circ$ data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04215) | [⬇️](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04215)\n*Ricardo Furbino Marques do Nascimento and Hugo M. R. Rios-Neto* \n\n Even though having more possession does not necessarily lead to winning,\nteams like Manchester City, Liverpool, and Leeds United notably have tried to\nrecover the ball quickly after they lost it over the past few years. Nowadays,\nsome of the top managers in the world apply high-pressing styles, and concepts\nsuch as the five-second rule, usually credited to Guardiola, have been\nspreading out [9][10], becoming a fundamental part of how lots of teams have\nplayed over the recent years. Expressions like "don\'t let them breathe" and\n"get the ball back as soon as possible" are often heard in the media [4][5][6],\nbut what are the actions that most lead to a change in possession?

Many applications can\nbenefit from automatically generated questions, but often it is necessary to\ncurate those questions, either by selecting or editing them. This task is\ninformative on its own, but it is typically done post-generation, and, thus,\nthe effort is wasted. In addition, most existing systems cannot incorporate\nthis feedback back into them easily. In this work, we present a system, GEN,\nthat learns from such (implicit) feedback. Following a pattern-based approach,\nit takes as input a small set of sentence/question pairs and creates patterns\nwhich are then applied to new unseen sentences. Each generated question, after\nbeing corrected by the user, is used as a new seed in the next iteration, so\nmore patterns are created each time. We also take advantage of the corrections\nmade by the user to score the patterns and therefore rank the generated\nquestions. Results show that GEN is able to improve by learning from both\nlevels of implicit feedback when compared to the version with no learning,\nconsidering the top 5, 10, and 20 questions.

Our\ngoal is to maximize a modified formulation of the Sharpe ratio subject to\ncardinality, box and budget constraints. The algorithm involves a projection\noperator to deal with these three constraints simultaneously and we implicitly\ncontrol transaction costs thanks to a rebalancing constraint. We also introduce\na suitable exact penalty function to manage the turnover constraint. In\naddition, we develop an ad hoc mutation operator to modify candidate exemplars\nin the highest level of the swarm. The experimental results, using three\nlarge-scale data sets, show that the inclusion of this procedure improves the\naccuracy of the solutions. Then, a comparison with other variants of the LLSO\nalgorithm and two state-of-the-art swarm optimizers points out the outstanding\nperformance of the proposed solver in terms of exploration capabilities and\nsolution quality. Finally, we assess the profitability of the portfolio\nallocation strategy in the last five years using an investible pool of 1119\nconstituents from the MSCI World Index.\n\n---------------\n\n### 29 Oct 2020 | [Lessons Learned from the 1st ARIEL Machine Learning Challenge: Correcting Transiting Exoplanet Light Curves for Stellar Spots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15996) | [⬇️](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15996)\n*Nikolaos Nikolaou, Ingo P.

However, several big challenges remain, many of\nwhich could be addressed using machine learning methodology. For instance, the\nmost prolific method for detecting exoplanets and inferring several of their\ncharacteristics, transit photometry, is very sensitive to the presence of\nstellar spots. The current practice in the literature is to identify the\neffects of spots visually and correct for them manually or discard the affected\ndata. This paper explores a first step towards fully automating the efficient\nand precise derivation of transit depths from transit light curves in the\npresence of stellar spots. The methods and results we present were obtained in\nthe context of the 1st Machine Learning Challenge organized for the European\nSpace Agency\'s upcoming Ariel mission. We first present the problem, the\nsimulated Ariel-like data and outline the Challenge while identifying best\npractices for organizing similar challenges in the future. Finally, we present\nthe solutions obtained by the top-5 winning teams, provide their code and\ndiscuss their implications. Successful solutions either construct highly\nnon-linear (w.r.t. the raw data) models with minimal preprocessing -deep neural\nnetworks and ensemble methods- or amount to obtaining meaningful statistics\nfrom the light curves, constructing linear models on which yields comparably\ngood predictive performance.\n\n---------------\n\n### 12 Sep 2016 | [Towards Miss Universe Automatic Prediction: The Evening Gown Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07547) | [⬇️](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07547)\n*Johanna Carvajal, Arnold Wiliem, Conrad Sanderson, Brian Lovell* \n\n Can we predict the winner of Miss Universe after watching how they stride\ndown the catwalk during the evening gown competition? Fashion gurus say they\ncan! In our work, we study this question from the perspective of computer\nvision. In particular, we want to understand whether existing computer vision\napproaches can be used to automatically extract the qualities exhibited by the\nMiss Universe winners during their catwalk. This study can pave the way towards\nnew vision-based applications for the fashion industry. To this end, we propose\na novel video dataset, called the Miss Universe dataset, comprising 10 years of\nthe evening gown competition selected between 1996-2010. We further propose two\nranking-related problems: (1) Miss Universe Listwise Ranking and (2) Miss\nUniverse Pairwise Ranking. In addition, we also develop an approach that\nsimultaneously addresses the two proposed problems. To describe the videos we\nemploy the recently proposed Stacked Fisher Vectors in conjunction with robust\nlocal spatio-temporal features. From our evaluation we found that although the\naddressed problems are extremely challenging, the proposed system is able to\nrank the winner in the top 3 best predicted scores for 5 out of 10 Miss\nUniverse competitions.\n\n---------------\n\n### 15 May 2023 | [What\'s the Meaning of Superhuman Performance in Today\'s NLU?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08414) | [⬇️](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08414)\n*Simone Tedeschi, Johan Bos, Thierry Declerck, Jan Hajic, Daniel Hershcovich, Eduard H.

This has led to claims of\nsuperhuman capabilities and the provocative idea that certain tasks have been\nsolved. In this position paper, we take a critical look at these claims and ask\nwhether PLMs truly have superhuman abilities and what the current benchmarks\nare really evaluating. We show that these benchmarks have serious limitations\naffecting the comparison between humans and PLMs and provide recommendations\nfor fairer and more transparent benchmarks.\n\n---------------\n\n### 09 Apr 2021 | [UPB at SemEval-2021 Task 8: Extracting Semantic Information on Measurements as Multi-Turn Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04549) | [⬇️](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04549)\n*Andrei-Marius Avram, George-Eduard Zaharia, Dumitru-Clementin Cercel, Mihai Dascalu* \n\n Extracting semantic information on measurements and counts is an important\ntopic in terms of analyzing scientific discourses. The 8th task of\nSemEval-2021: Counts and Measurements (MeasEval) aimed to boost research in\nthis direction by providing a new dataset on which participants train their\nmodels to extract meaningful information on measurements from scientific texts.\nThe competition is composed of five subtasks that build on top of each other:\n(1) quantity span identification, (2) unit extraction from the identified\nquantities and their value modifier classification, (3) span identification for\nmeasured entities and measured properties, (4) qualifier span identification,\nand (5) relation extraction between the identified quantities, measured\nentities, measured properties, and qualifiers. We approached these challenges\nby first identifying the quantities, extracting their units of measurement,\nclassifying them with corresponding modifiers, and afterwards using them to\njointly solve the last three subtasks in a multi-turn question answering\nmanner.

As a result, Deep Neural Networks have supplanted other\napproaches to solving problems in these areas, and enabled many new\napplications. While the design of Deep Neural Nets is still something of an art\nform, in our work we have found basic principles of design space exploration\nused to develop embedded microprocessor architectures to be highly applicable\nto the design of Deep Neural Net architectures. In particular, we have used\nthese design principles to create a novel Deep Neural Net called SqueezeNet\nthat requires as little as 480KB of storage for its model parameters.

In the\narea of evolutionary computation, the traveling thief problem (TTP) has gained\nincreasing interest over the last 5 years. In this paper, we investigate the\neffect of weights on such problems, in the sense that the cost of traveling\nincreases with respect to the weights of nodes already visited during a tour.\nThis provides abstractions of important TSP variants such as the Traveling\nThief Problem and time dependent TSP variants, and allows to study precisely\nthe increase in difficulty caused by weight dependence. We provide a\n3.59-approximation for this weight dependent version of TSP with metric\ndistances and bounded positive weights. Furthermore, we conduct experimental\ninvestigations for simple randomized local search with classical mutation\noperators and two variants of the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm EAX\nadapted to the weighted TSP.

The meta-learned policy is then used to learn a good\nprogramming policy, utilizing the trial trajectories and their rewards for\nsimilar questions in the support set.

However, they\nstill face two major challenges: hallucination and outdated information after\nthe training phase. These challenges take center stage in critical domains like\nclimate change, where obtaining accurate and up-to-date information from\nreliable sources in a limited time is essential and difficult. To overcome\nthese barriers, one potential solution is to provide LLMs with access to\nexternal, scientifically accurate, and robust sources (long-term memory) to\ncontinuously update their knowledge and prevent the propagation of inaccurate,\nincorrect, or outdated information. In this study, we enhanced GPT-4 by\nintegrating the information from the Sixth Assessment Report of the\nIntergovernmental (IPCC AR6), the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and reliable\nsource in this domain.

The answers and their sources were\nevaluated by our team of IPCC authors, who used their expert knowledge to score\nthe accuracy of the answers from 1 (very-low) to 5 (very-high).

It has driven the\ndiscovery of several optimization techniques such as cutting planes,\nbranch-and-bound, local search, Lagrangian relaxation, and simulated annealing.\nThe last five years have seen the emergence of promising techniques where\n(graph) neural networks have been capable to learn new combinatorial\nalgorithms. The main question is whether deep learning can learn better\nheuristics from data, i.e. replacing human-engineered heuristics? This is\nappealing because developing algorithms to tackle efficiently NP-hard problems\nmay require years of research, and many industry problems are combinatorial by\nnature. In this work, we propose to adapt the recent successful Transformer\narchitecture originally developed for natural language processing to the\ncombinatorial TSP. Training is done by reinforcement learning, hence without\nTSP training solutions, and decoding uses beam search. We report improved\nperformances over recent learned heuristics with an optimal gap of 0.004% for\nTSP50 and 0.39% for TSP100.\n2. <b> ELI5: Long Form Question Answering </b> \n Abstract: We introduce the first large-scale corpus for long-form question answering, a\ntask requiring elaborate and in-depth answers to open-ended questions.

We also introduce\na suitable exact penalty function to manage the turnover constraint. In\naddition, we develop an ad hoc mutation operator to modify candidate exemplars\nin the highest level of the swarm. The experimental results, using three\nlarge-scale data sets, show that the inclusion of this procedure improves the\naccuracy of the solutions. Then, a comparison with other variants of the LLSO\nalgorithm and two state-of-the-art swarm optimizers points out the outstanding\nperformance of the proposed solver in terms of exploration capabilities and\nsolution quality. Finally, we assess the profitability of the portfolio\nallocation strategy in the last five years using an investible pool of 1119\nconstituents from the MSCI World Index.\n8. <b> Lessons Learned from the 1st ARIEL Machine Learning Challenge: Correcting Transiting Exoplanet Light Curves for Stellar Spots </b> \n Abstract: The last decade has witnessed a rapid growth of the field of exoplanet\ndiscovery and characterisation. However, several big challenges remain, many of\nwhich could be addressed using machine learning methodology. For instance, the\nmost prolific method for detecting exoplanets and inferring several of their\ncharacteristics, transit photometry, is very sensitive to the presence of\nstellar spots. The current practice in the literature is to identify the\neffects of spots visually and correct for them manually or discard the affected\ndata. This paper explores a first step towards fully automating the efficient\nand precise derivation of transit depths from transit light curves in the\npresence of stellar spots. The methods and results we present were obtained in\nthe context of the 1st Machine Learning Challenge organized for the European\nSpace Agency's upcoming Ariel mission. We first present the problem, the\nsimulated Ariel-like data and outline the Challenge while identifying best\npractices for organizing similar challenges in the future. Finally, we present\nthe solutions obtained by the top-5 winning teams, provide their code and\ndiscuss their implications. Successful solutions either construct highly\nnon-linear (w.r.t. the raw data) models with minimal preprocessing -deep neural\nnetworks and ensemble methods- or amount to obtaining meaningful statistics\nfrom the light curves, constructing linear models on which yields comparably\ngood predictive performance.\n9. <b> Towards Miss Universe Automatic Prediction: The Evening Gown Competition </b> \n Abstract: Can we predict the winner of Miss Universe after watching how they stride\ndown the catwalk during the evening gown competition? Fashion gurus say they\ncan! In our work, we study this question from the perspective of computer\nvision. In particular, we want to understand whether existing computer vision\napproaches can be used to automatically extract the qualities exhibited by the\nMiss Universe winners during their catwalk. This study can pave the way towards\nnew vision-based applications for the fashion industry. To this end, we propose\na novel video dataset, called the Miss Universe dataset, comprising 10 years of\nthe evening gown competition selected between 1996-2010. We further propose two\nranking-related problems: (1) Miss Universe Listwise Ranking and (2) Miss\nUniverse Pairwise Ranking. In addition, we also develop an approach that\nsimultaneously addresses the two proposed problems. To describe the videos we\nemploy the recently proposed Stacked Fisher Vectors in conjunction with robust\nlocal spatio-temporal features. From our evaluation we found that although the\naddressed problems are extremely challenging, the proposed system is able to\nrank the winner in the top 3 best predicted scores for 5 out of 10 Miss\nUniverse competitions.\n10. <b> What's the Meaning of Superhuman Performance in Today's NLU? </b> \n Abstract: In the last five years, there has been a significant focus in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) on developing larger Pretrained Language Models\n(PLMs) and introducing benchmarks such as SuperGLUE and SQuAD to measure their\nabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and reading comprehension.\nThese PLMs have achieved impressive results on these benchmarks, even\nsurpassing human performance in some cases. This has led to claims of\nsuperhuman capabilities and the provocative idea that certain tasks have been\nsolved. In this position paper, we take a critical look at these claims and ask\nwhether PLMs truly have superhuman abilities and what the current benchmarks\nare really evaluating. We show that these benchmarks have serious limitations\naffecting the comparison between humans and PLMs and provide recommendations\nfor fairer and more transparent benchmarks.\n11. <b> UPB at SemEval-2021 Task 8: Extracting Semantic Information on Measurements as Multi-Turn Question Answering </b> \n Abstract: Extracting semantic information on measurements and counts is an important\ntopic in terms of analyzing scientific discourses. The 8th task of\nSemEval-2021: Counts and Measurements (MeasEval) aimed to boost research in\nthis direction by providing a new dataset on which participants train their\nmodels to extract meaningful information on measurements from scientific texts.\nThe competition is composed of five subtasks that build on top of each other:\n(1) quantity span identification, (2) unit extraction from the identified\nquantities and their value modifier classification, (3) span identification for\nmeasured entities and measured properties, (4) qualifier span identification,\nand (5) relation extraction between the identified quantities, measured\nentities, measured properties, and qualifiers. We approached these challenges\nby first identifying the quantities, extracting their units of measurement,\nclassifying them with corresponding modifiers, and afterwards using them to\njointly solve the last three subtasks in a multi-turn question answering\nmanner. Our best performing model obtained an overlapping F1-score of 36.91% on\nthe test set.\n12. <b> Keynote: Small Neural Nets Are Beautiful: Enabling Embedded Systems with Small Deep-Neural-Network Architectures </b> \n Abstract: Over the last five years Deep Neural Nets have offered more accurate\nsolutions to many problems in speech recognition, and computer vision, and\nthese solutions have surpassed a threshold of acceptability for many\napplications. As a result, Deep Neural Networks have supplanted other\napproaches to solving problems in these areas, and enabled many new\napplications. While the design of Deep Neural Nets is still something of an art\nform, in our work we have found basic principles of design space exploration\nused to develop embedded microprocessor architectures to be highly applicable\nto the design of Deep Neural Net architectures. In particular, we have used\nthese design principles to create a novel Deep Neural Net called SqueezeNet\nthat requires as little as 480KB of storage for its model parameters. We have\nfurther integrated all these experiences to develop something of a playbook for\ncreating small Deep Neural Nets for embedded systems.\n13. <b> The Node Weight Dependent Traveling Salesperson Problem: Approximation Algorithms and Randomized Search Heuristics </b> \n Abstract: Several important optimization problems in the area of vehicle routing can be\nseen as a variant of the classical Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). In the\narea of evolutionary computation, the traveling thief problem (TTP) has gained\nincreasing interest over the last 5 years. In this paper, we investigate the\neffect of weights on such problems, in the sense that the cost of traveling\nincreases with respect to the weights of nodes already visited during a tour.\nThis provides abstractions of important TSP variants such as the Traveling\nThief Problem and time dependent TSP variants, and allows to study precisely\nthe increase in difficulty caused by weight dependence. We provide a\n3.59-approximation for this weight dependent version of TSP with metric\ndistances and bounded positive weights. Furthermore, we conduct experimental\ninvestigations for simple randomized local search with classical mutation\noperators and two variants of the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm EAX\nadapted to the weighted TSP. Our results show the impact of the node weights on\nthe position of the nodes in the resulting tour.\n14. <b> The Model Counting Competition 2020 </b> \n Abstract: Many computational problems in modern society account to probabilistic\nreasoning, statistics, and combinatorics. A variety of these real-world\nquestions can be solved by representing the question in (Boolean) formulas and\nassociating the number of models of the formula directly with the answer to the\nquestion. Since there has been an increasing interest in practical problem\nsolving for model counting over the last years, the Model Counting (MC)\nCompetition was conceived in fall 2019. The competition aims to foster\napplications, identify new challenging benchmarks, and to promote new solvers\nand improve established solvers for the model counting problem and versions\nthereof. We hope that the results can be a good indicator of the current\nfeasibility of model counting and spark many new applications. In this paper,\nwe report on details of the Model Counting Competition 2020, about carrying out\nthe competition, and the results. The competition encompassed three versions of\nthe model counting problem, which we evaluated in separate tracks. The first\ntrack featured the model counting problem (MC), which asks for the number of\nmodels of a given Boolean formula. On the second track, we challenged\ndevelopers to submit programs that solve the weighted model counting problem\n(WMC). The last track was dedicated to projected model counting (PMC). In\ntotal, we received a surprising number of 9 solvers in 34 versions from 8\ngroups.\n15. <b> Cutting-edge 3D Medical Image Segmentation Methods in 2020: Are Happy Families All Alike? </b> \n Abstract: Segmentation is one of the most important and popular tasks in medical image\nanalysis, which plays a critical role in disease diagnosis, surgical planning,\nand prognosis evaluation. During the past five years, on the one hand,\nthousands of medical image segmentation methods have been proposed for various\norgans and lesions in different medical images, which become more and more\nchallenging to fairly compare different methods. On the other hand,\ninternational segmentation challenges can provide a transparent platform to\nfairly evaluate and compare different methods. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive review of the top methods in ten 3D medical image segmentation\nchallenges during 2020, covering a variety of tasks and datasets. We also\nidentify the "happy-families" practices in the cutting-edge segmentation\nmethods, which are useful for developing powerful segmentation approaches.\nFinally, we discuss open research problems that should be addressed in the\nfuture. We also maintain a list of cutting-edge segmentation methods at\n\url{https://github.com/JunMa11/SOTA-MedSeg}.\n16. <b> Few-Shot Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Meta Reinforcement Learning </b> \n Abstract: Complex question-answering (CQA) involves answering complex natural-language\nquestions on a knowledge base (KB). However, the conventional neural program\ninduction (NPI) approach exhibits uneven performance when the questions have\ndifferent types, harboring inherently different characteristics, e.g.,\ndifficulty level. This paper proposes a meta-reinforcement learning approach to\nprogram induction in CQA to tackle the potential distributional bias in\nquestions. Our method quickly and effectively adapts the meta-learned\nprogrammer to new questions based on the most similar questions retrieved from\nthe training data. The meta-learned policy is then used to learn a good\nprogramming policy, utilizing the trial trajectories and their rewards for\nsimilar questions in the support set. Our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on the CQA dataset (Saha et al., 2018) while using only five trial\ntrajectories for the top-5 retrieved questions in each support set, and\nmetatraining on tasks constructed from only 1% of the training set. We have\nreleased our code at https://github.com/DevinJake/MRL-CQA.\n17. <b> chatClimate: Grounding Conversational AI in Climate Science </b> \n Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,\nachieving remarkable results in question-answering tasks (QA). However, they\nstill face two major challenges: hallucination and outdated information after\nthe training phase. These challenges take center stage in critical domains like\nclimate change, where obtaining accurate and up-to-date information from\nreliable sources in a limited time is essential and difficult. To overcome\nthese barriers, one potential solution is to provide LLMs with access to\nexternal, scientifically accurate, and robust sources (long-term memory) to\ncontinuously update their knowledge and prevent the propagation of inaccurate,\nincorrect, or outdated information. In this study, we enhanced GPT-4 by\nintegrating the information from the Sixth Assessment Report of the\nIntergovernmental (IPCC AR6), the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and reliable\nsource in this domain. We present our conversational AI prototype, available at\nwww.chatclimate.ai and demonstrate its ability to answer challenging questions\naccurately in three different QA scenarios: asking from 1) GPT-4, 2)\nchatClimate, and 3) hybrid chatClimate. The answers and their sources were\nevaluated by our team of IPCC authors, who used their expert knowledge to score\nthe accuracy of the answers from 1 (very-low) to 5 (very-high). The evaluation\nshowed that the hybrid chatClimate provided more accurate answers, highlighting\nthe effectiveness of our solution. This approach can be easily scaled for\nchatbots in specific domains, enabling the delivery of reliable and accurate\ninformation.\n18. <b> AIR5: Five Pillars of Artificial Intelligence Research </b> \n Abstract: In this article, we provide and overview of what we consider to be some of\nthe most pressing research questions facing the fields of artificial\nintelligence (AI) and computational intelligence (CI); with the latter focusing\non algorithms that are inspired by various natural phenomena. We demarcate\nthese questions using five unique Rs - namely, (i) rationalizability, (ii)\nresilience, (iii) reproducibility, (iv) realism, and (v) responsibility.\nNotably, just as air serves as the basic element of biological life, the term\nAIR5 - cumulatively referring to the five aforementioned Rs - is introduced\nherein to mark some of the basic elements of artificial life (supporting the\nsustained growth of AI and CI). A brief summary of each of the Rs is presented,\nhighlighting their relevance as pillars of future research in this arena.\n19. <b> No One is Perfect: Analysing the Performance of Question Answering Components over the DBpedia Knowledge Graph </b> \n Abstract: Question answering (QA) over knowledge graphs has gained significant momentum\nover the past five years due to the increasing availability of large knowledge\ngraphs and the rising importance of question answering for user interaction.\nDBpedia has been the most prominently used knowledge graph in this setting and\nmost approaches currently use a pipeline of processing steps connecting a\nsequence of components. In this article, we analyse and micro evaluate the\nbehaviour of 29 available QA components for DBpedia knowledge graph that were\nreleased by the research community since 2010. As a result, we provide a\nperspective on collective failure cases, suggest characteristics of QA\ncomponents that prevent them from performing better and provide future\nchallenges and research directions for the field.\n20. <b> Large Language Models and Prompt Engineering for Biomedical Query Focused Multi-Document Summarisation </b> \n Abstract: This paper reports on the use of prompt engineering and GPT-3.5 for\nbiomedical query-focused multi-document summarisation. Using GPT-3.5 and\nappropriate prompts, our system achieves top ROUGE-F1 results in the task of\nobtaining short-paragraph-sized answers to biomedical questions in the 2023\nBioASQ Challenge (BioASQ 11b). This paper confirms what has been observed in\nother domains: 1) Prompts that incorporated few-shot samples generally improved\non their counterpart zero-shot variants; 2) The largest improvement was\nachieved by retrieval augmented generation. The fact that these prompts allow\nour top runs to rank within the top two runs of BioASQ 11b demonstrate the\npower of using adequate prompts for Large Language Models in general, and\nGPT-3.5 in particular, for query-focused summarisation.\n \n Given the following scientific paper abstracts, take a deep breath and lets think step by step to answer the question.

PIR Research Assignment: Systems Development Process
Overview
In this research assignment of the post-implementation review, student teams describe the process of systems development for the information systems project that is being studied and report (about 5-6 pages or so) in detail on the following questions. Typically, these questions will have to be addressed to your research informants (those working in the organization whose information system development project you investigating).
1.  Development Policy and Procedures or Standards
Development Policy, Procedures and/or Standards are published documents describing a prescribed development methodology that anyone within the company or within the IT organization must use for new IT application development, application upgrade, or application acquisition. Policies are the highest level of organization directive, usually encompassing mandatory staff behaviors, i.e., actions that must be taken while developing or acquiring an application. Procedures are typically step-by-step instructions to perform a specific business process or task. Standards usually are minimum performance models that maybe used as a basis for comparison or judgment.
1.1.          Does the organization have a published policy and/or procedures covering outsourcing or service level agreements with outside vendors? If the policy and/or procedures exist, please obtain a copy of the relevant policy and/or procedures and summarize them in the report.  Researchers can find information online about what service level agreements are and why they are important to have.  Being this is a cloud solution with a vendor product, no organization would go into this without some type of SLA.  Researchers should provide definition on SLA’s and in your paper note that an SLA would be advised
As an example of this, let's say the organization is using one or more Cloud providers to host its business software applications. Is there a policy defined for contracting to Cloud providers?
1.2.          If there are no published application development/acquisition policy and/or procedures, are there standards or a "best practices" that the IT organization follows to ensure that development and/or acquisition activities are performed uniformly and completely? If yes, are they written? If they are written, please obtain a copy and, again, summarize them in your report. If they are not written (i.e. they exist but are informal), what are they and how are they conveyed to the project manager and application designer?  Researchers should do internet searches against ITIL.  ITIL is the IT industry standard that drives process and procedures.  IT is the ITIL or ITSM process that would apply to ensuring deployments are managed methodically.  Again, in your paper this should be noted as a process they would have followed to ensure a smooth implementation.  
1.3.          If no development/acquisition procedures or standards exist, are application designers or development/acquisition project managers expected to use a particular process or methodology? If yes, what is that process and how is that information conveyed to the project manager and application designer?  SKIP THIS QUESTION
1.4.          Was the methodology used similar to any of the methodologies mentioned in the readings on Systems Development (i.e. Waterfall/Agile/Scrum/RUP ) [See pages 345-354] FOR THIS ONE:  make sure your paper uses the textbook as a reference in defining these two methodologies and it is okay to note that you don’t know which was used.  
1.5.  Does the organization have IT Governance, Risk and Compliance Requirements in place? FOR THIS ONE:  IT Governance is the Change Management process as you define this in the question above that will apply to this question. 
2.  Establishing the requirements / project leadership
2.1.          How was the need for the subject application established? You will address this one in a hypothetical.  The next few questions are examples of needs assessments and are in the textbook but also can be defined on the internet.  Your researches can start defining these terms again noting that one or all of these were used to determine Quickbooks need. 
2.1.1.     Was a formal needs analysis performed? Applies to 2.1
2.1.2.     Who made the initial request for the activity that culminated in this application development/acquisition? Was a feasibility study performed? Applies to 2.1
2.2.          Describe the process of gathering the business requirements for the information system? Researchers should be able to find definitions and examples what business requirements are.  More information around business requirements will be on a project management website.  Check out PMI.org as a resource.
2.2.1.     Did the requirements gathering effort for the application include all the people who could have been included? Were all stakeholders represented? Define stakeholders and again as a hypothetical note who might have been part of the requirement gathering efforts – think about who would be using this application and what they need from it. 
2.2.2.     Who were the participants? How did they contribute? SKIP THIS ONE as you will note the hypothetical in 2.2.1
2.2.3.     What formal documentation was developed during the requirements gathering process?  SKIP THIS ONE
2.3.          Who reviewed the requirements? Who signed off on them? Who was (were) the executive sponsor(s) for the project?  Define executive sponsorship from a project standpoint.  Again, I would more to pmi.org for this level of information/definition.  But it is likely safe to note that in a smaller company often times the executive sponsor is likely upper leadersip.
2.4.          Who were the real champions of the project? What motivated them?  SKIP THIS ONE
2.5.          How did the project leader(s) manage overall communications to all stakeholders?  This will also be a hypothetical notation in your paper.  Research of think about ways an organization communicates projects and deployments. 
2.6.          Were there issues associated with the project development / acquisition and implementation that generated disagreements within the organization's project team? If so, how were these issues resolved?  SKIP THIS ONE.  The organization is small and likely don’t have a dedication project management team which would manage these things.  
2.7.          Change Management – How were the changes managed? If you thoroughly define change management up above that will cover this question. 
                 
3.  Systems development options and decisions
3.1.        Does the organization you are studying have a viable IT application development staff?  SKIP THIS ONE – again the size of the company leads me to believe they do not and could be part of why they are moving to cloud supported services.  I think it is okay to note something like that in your paper.  There may even be internet articles on why IT departments are reducing App Dev teams as they move to cloud supported solutions. 
3.2.        What were the options considered for developing or purchasing the application?  
3.2.1.     Was a decision made to develop the application in-house or to outsource the development? You can re-iterate in your paper that this implementation was to move from in house applications to an outsources solution
3.2.2.     Was a decision made to purchase an existing commercially available application?  SKIP
3.2.3.     Which of these options were considered prior to this decision?  SKIP
3.3.          Who made the decision? When was it made? If justification for the decision was announced, how was it justified?  SKIP
3.4.          Is the decision about how to develop (or outsource/purchase) the application part of a larger movement by this organization "to the cloud" or even just part of a shift towards using more purchased applications?  
3.5.          What kind of RFP (Request for Proposal) process was followed (if any)?  Researchers should be able to find information on the internet or in the book on what an RFP is and why they are important.  Again, you will hypothetically note if this is something they did as part of the cloud solution decision making process.  With smaller companies, especially unregulated or private companies, they don’t always do this so its okay to note that, but to also further define the importance in having an RFP (even if not regulated to or required to)
3.6.          If an external vendor was engaged was a service level agreement executed with that vendor?  May be defined up above. 
3.7.          Did the application need to be customized to meet all the business requirements?  Who was responsible for the customizing? Almost all cloud solutions have to be customized to meet the needs outlined during the requirements gathering.  You can maybe get more information form new point of contact about this.  
3.8.          Were any business requirements changed to fit the application? Who was responsible for approving the changes?  SKIP THIS ONE
Application implementation  The questions below can be further explained with your new contact.  Again they will be hypothetical as we don’t know exactly how Raymark completed these. 
The work of the development or acquisition team doesn't end with the delivery of a completed application. There is a lot left to do. Implementing the information system is a complex process that includes testing, training, documentation, acceptance, integration with existing systems, and cutover to production.
4.1.  How did the project participants know that the development process was completed?
4.2.  Who managed the implementation process (IT staff, business user, or vendor)?
4.3.  Who participated in the implementation process (testing, installation, acceptance, training, ready for use, cutover)? Include names and organizations?
4.4.  What additional testing was performed during implementation? System testing? Stress Testing? Beta testing? Acceptance testing? Who prepared the test scripts?
4.5.  How was system acceptance accomplished? What acceptance criteria were used? Who defined the criteria? Was there any concern that the application wouldn't be accepted? Please explain.
4.6.  How was the cutover to the new application accomplished? When was it accomplished?Was any consideration given to whether the application could accommodate projected horizontal and/or vertical growth? Could it? 
4.7.  Are any special skills, training, or expertise necessary to install, implement (and customize) this application?  Does the organization staff have those skills and expertise? If not, what actions have the organization taken to acquire them? 
4.8.  How were users and operators trained for the new system?

# ACW - Take on Quickbooks Cloud Services
From an ITIL practice cchange management perspective explain how Quickbooks cloud services and development allow production deployment for ccustomers that is multi-tenant?

From an **ITIL** (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) **change management** perspective, QuickBooks **cloud services** and **development** enable **multi-tenant production deployment** for customers through a well-defined and controlled process. Here's how:

**Change Request**: The development team initiates a change request for deploying a new feature or update to the QuickBooks cloud services. The request includes details about the change, its purpose, and potential impacts on the multi-tenant environment.
**Change Assessment**: The change management team assesses the change request, considering factors such as the scope of the change, potential risks, and compatibility with the existing multi-tenant architecture. They evaluate how the change will affect multiple customers sharing the same infrastructure.
**Change Approval**: After a thorough assessment, the change request is approved by the designated change advisory board (CAB). The CAB ensures that the change aligns with the overall business goals and multi-tenant strategy of QuickBooks.
**Change Planning**: Once approved, a detailed change plan is created, outlining the steps involved in implementing the change in the multi-tenant environment. This plan includes considerations for minimizing disruption to customers, ensuring data isolation, and maintaining service availability.
**Change Testing**: Before deploying the change to the production environment, it undergoes rigorous testing in a multi-tenant test environment. This step verifies that the change functions as intended and does not introduce any adverse effects on other tenants sharing the infrastructure.
**Change Implementation**: After successful testing, the change is deployed to the production environment following the approved change plan. The deployment process is carefully orchestrated to ensure a smooth transition for all customers in the multi-tenant setup.
**Post-Implementation Review**: After the change is deployed, a post-implementation review is conducted to assess the success of the change and identify any lessons learned. This review helps in continuously improving the change management process for future multi-tenant deployments.
Throughout the process, QuickBooks ensures that the multi-tenant architecture maintains data isolation, security, and performance for each customer. The change management process helps in minimizing risks, reducing downtime, and ensuring a stable and reliable multi-tenant environment for QuickBooks customers.

By following ITIL change management best practices, QuickBooks can effectively manage and deploy changes to its cloud services while maintaining the integrity and quality of service for its multi-tenant customer base.

How is Quickbooks cloud hosted?

**QuickBooks cloud hosting** is a **deployment model** where QuickBooks accounting software and its associated data are hosted on **remote servers**, typically in a **data center** managed by a third-party **hosting provider**. This allows users to access QuickBooks and their financial data securely over the internet, without the need for local installation or maintenance of the software.

Here's how QuickBooks cloud hosting works:

**Infrastructure**: The hosting provider maintains a robust infrastructure consisting of servers, storage systems, and networking equipment in secure data centers. These data centers are designed to ensure high availability, redundancy, and performance.

**Virtualization**: The hosting provider uses virtualization technology to create separate virtual environments for each customer. Each virtual environment runs its own instance of the QuickBooks software and has dedicated resources allocated to it, ensuring data isolation and security.

**Remote Access**: Users can access their QuickBooks software and data remotely using a web browser or a remote desktop connection. They log in to their virtual environment using secure authentication methods, such as usernames and passwords or multi-factor authentication.

**Data Storage and Backup**: All QuickBooks data is stored on the hosting provider's servers, which are regularly backed up to ensure data integrity and availability. The hosting provider implements data backup and disaster recovery mechanisms to protect customer data

**Maintenance and Updates**: The hosting provider takes care of software updates, patches, and maintenance tasks. They ensure that the QuickBooks software is up to date and compatible with the latest security and performance enhancements.

**Scalability and Customization**: QuickBooks cloud hosting allows for easy scalability, as resources can be allocated or adjusted based on the customer's requirements. Customers can also customize their QuickBooks environment by integrating third-party applications or plugins.

**Security Measures**: The hosting provider implements various security measures to protect customer data, such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and access controls. They adhere to industry standards and compliance requirements to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data.

By leveraging cloud hosting, QuickBooks users can access their accounting software and financial data from anywhere with an internet connection. This eliminates the need for local IT infrastructure, reduces maintenance costs, and provides flexibility and scalability for businesses of different sizes.

It's important to note that QuickBooks offers its own cloud-based solution called **QuickBooks Online**, which is a separate product from the traditional QuickBooks Desktop software. QuickBooks Online is a **fully cloud-based accounting platform** hosted and managed directly by Intuit, the company behind QuickBooks.

('# 🩺🔍 Search Results\n### 24 May 2022 | Core Challenges in Embodied Vision-Language Planning | ⬇️\nJonathan Francis, Nariaki Kitamura, Felix Labelle, Xiaopeng Lu, Ingrid Navarro, Jean Oh \n\nRecent advances in the areas of multimodal machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI. Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered, more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning (EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments, as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers real-world deployment.\n\n---------------\n\n### 03 Mar 2020 | Adaptive Prior Selection for Repertoire-based Online Adaptation in Robotics | ⬇️\nRituraj Kaushik, Pierre Desreumaux, Jean-Baptiste Mouret \n\nRepertoire-based learning is a data-efficient adaptation approach based on a two-step process in which (1) a large and diverse set of policies is learned in simulation, and (2) a planning or learning algorithm chooses the most appropriate policies according to the current situation (e.g., a damaged robot, a new object, etc.). In this paper, we relax the assumption of previous works that a single repertoire is enough for adaptation. Instead, we generate repertoires for many different situations (e.g., with a missing leg, on different floors, etc.) and let our algorithm selects the most useful prior. Our main contribution is an algorithm, APROL (Adaptive Prior selection for Repertoire-based Online Learning) to plan the next action by incorporating these priors when the robot has no information about the current situation. We evaluate APROL on two simulated tasks: (1) pushing unknown objects of various shapes and sizes with a robotic arm and (2) a goal reaching task with a damaged hexapod robot. We compare with "Reset-free Trial and Error" (RTE) and various single repertoire-based baselines. The results show that APROL solves both the tasks in less interaction time than the baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate APROL on a real, damaged hexapod that quickly learns to pick compensatory policies to reach a goal by avoiding obstacles in the path.\n\n---------------\n\n### 10 Nov 2023 | A Survey of AI Text-to-Image and AI Text-to-Video Generators | ⬇️\nAditi Singh \n\nText-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generation models are revolutionary technologies that use deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create images and videos from textual descriptions. This paper investigates cutting-edge approaches in the discipline of Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generations. The survey provides an overview of the existing literature as well as an analysis of the approaches used in various studies. It covers data preprocessing techniques, neural network types, and evaluation metrics used in the field. In addition, the paper discusses the challenges and limitations of Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generations, as well as future research directions. Overall, these models have promising potential for a wide range of applications such as video production, content creation, and digital marketing.\n\n---------------\n\n### 17 Apr 2023 | Affordances from Human Videos as a Versatile Representation for Robotics | ⬇️\nShikhar Bahl, Russell Mendonca, Lili Chen, Unnat Jain, Deepak Pathak \n\nBuilding a robot that can understand and learn to interact by watching humans has inspired several vision problems. However, despite some successful results on static datasets, it remains unclear how current models can be used on a robot directly. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging videos of human interactions in an environment centric manner. Utilizing internet videos of human behavior, we train a visual affordance model that estimates where and how in the scene a human is likely to interact. The structure of these behavioral affordances directly enables the robot to perform many complex tasks. We show how to seamlessly integrate our affordance model with four robot learning paradigms including offline imitation learning, exploration, goal-conditioned learning, and action parameterization for reinforcement learning. We show the efficacy of our approach, which we call VRB, across 4 real world environments, over 10 different tasks, and 2 robotic platforms operating in the wild.

The creative sectors have always been early adopters of AI technologies and this continues to be the case. As a matter of fact, recent technological developments keep pushing the boundaries of intelligent systems in creative applications: the critically acclaimed movie "Sunspring", released in 2016, was entirely written by AI technology, and the first-ever Music Album, called "Hello World", produced using AI has been released this year. Simultaneously, the exploratory nature of the creative process is raising important technical challenges for AI such as the ability for AI-powered techniques to be accurate under limited data resources, as opposed to the conventional "Big Data" approach, or the ability to process, analyse and match data from multiple modalities (text, sound, images, etc.) at the same time. The purpose of this white paper is to understand future technological advances in AI and their growing impact on creative industries. This paper addresses the following questions: Where does AI operate in creative Industries? What is its operative role? How will AI transform creative industries in the next ten years? This white paper aims to provide a realistic perspective of the scope of AI actions in creative industries, proposes a vision of how this technology could contribute to research and development works in such context, and identifies research and development challenges.\n\n---------------\n\n### 01 Feb 2024 | Where are we in the search for an Artificial Visual Cortex for Embodied Intelligence? | ⬇️\nArjun Majumdar, Karmesh Yadav, Sergio Arnaud, Yecheng Jason Ma, Claire Chen, Sneha Silwal, Aryan Jain, Vincent-Pierre Berges, Pieter Abbeel, Jitendra Malik, Dhruv Batra, Yixin Lin, Oleksandr Maksymets, Aravind Rajeswaran, Franziska Meier \n\nWe present the largest and most comprehensive empirical study of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) or visual 'foundation models' for Embodied AI. First, we curate CortexBench, consisting of 17 different tasks spanning locomotion, navigation, dexterous, and mobile manipulation. Next, we systematically evaluate existing PVRs and find that none are universally dominant. To study the effect of pre-training data size and diversity, we combine over 4,000 hours of egocentric videos from 7 different sources (over 4.3M images) and ImageNet to train different-sized vision transformers using Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) on slices of this data. Contrary to inferences from prior work, we find that scaling dataset size and diversity does not improve performance universally (but does so on average). Our largest model, named VC-1, outperforms all prior PVRs on average but does not universally dominate either. Next, we show that task- or domain-specific adaptation of VC-1 leads to substantial gains, with VC-1 (adapted) achieving competitive or superior performance than the best known results on all of the benchmarks in CortexBench. Finally, we present real-world hardware experiments, in which VC-1 and VC-1 (adapted) outperform the strongest pre-existing PVR. Overall, this paper presents no new techniques but a rigorous systematic evaluation, a broad set of findings about PVRs (that in some cases, refute those made in narrow domains in prior work), and open-sourced code and models (that required over 10,000 GPU-hours to train) for the benefit of the research community.\n\n---------------\n\n### 18 Oct 2023 | From Neural Activations to Concepts: A Survey on Explaining Concepts in Neural Networks | ⬇️\nJae Hee Lee, Sergio Lanza, Stefan Wermter \n\nIn this paper, we review recent approaches for explaining concepts in neural networks. Concepts can act as a natural link between learning and reasoning: once the concepts are identified that a neural learning system uses, one can integrate those concepts with a reasoning system for inference or use a reasoning system to act upon them to improve or enhance the learning system. On the other hand, knowledge can not only be extracted from neural networks but concept knowledge can also be inserted into neural network architectures. Since integrating learning and reasoning is at the core of neuro-symbolic AI, the insights gained from this survey can serve as an important step towards realizing neuro-symbolic AI based on explainable concepts.\n\n---------------\n\n### 09 Oct 2019 | Imagined Value Gradients: Model-Based Policy Optimization with Transferable Latent Dynamics Models | ⬇️\nArunkumar Byravan, Jost Tobias Springenberg, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Roland Hafner, Michael Neunert, Thomas Lampe, Noah Siegel, Nicolas Heess, Martin Riedmiller \n\nHumans are masters at quickly learning many complex tasks, relying on an approximate understanding of the dynamics of their environments. In much the same way, we would like our learning agents to quickly adapt to new tasks. In this paper, we explore how model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) can facilitate transfer to new tasks. We develop an algorithm that learns an action-conditional, predictive model of expected future observations, rewards and values from which a policy can be derived by following the gradient of the estimated value along imagined trajectories. We show how robust policy optimization can be achieved in robot manipulation tasks even with approximate models that are learned directly from vision and proprioception. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in a transfer learning scenario, re-using previously learned models on tasks with different reward structures and visual distractors, and show a significant improvement in learning speed compared to strong off-policy baselines. Videos with results can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/ivg-corl19\n\n---------------\n\n### 08 Mar 2016 | Deep Tracking: Seeing Beyond Seeing Using Recurrent Neural Networks | ⬇️\nPeter Ondruska, Ingmar Posner \n\nThis paper presents to the best of our knowledge the first end-to-end object tracking approach which directly maps from raw sensor input to object tracks in sensor space without requiring any feature engineering or system identification in the form of plant or sensor models. Specifically, our system accepts a stream of raw sensor data at one end and, in real-time, produces an estimate of the entire environment state at the output including even occluded objects. We achieve this by framing the problem as a deep learning task and exploit sequence models in the form of recurrent neural networks to learn a mapping from sensor measurements to object tracks. In particular, we propose a learning method based on a form of input dropout which allows learning in an unsupervised manner, only based on raw, occluded sensor data without access to ground-truth annotations. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the task of tracking objects in 2D laser data -- as commonly encountered in robotics applications -- and show that it learns to track many dynamic objects despite occlusions and the presence of sensor noise.\n\n---------------\n\n### 26 Sep 2023 | Creating Trustworthy LLMs: Dealing with Hallucinations in Healthcare AI | ⬇️\nMuhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad, Ilker Yaramis, Taposh Dutta Roy \n\nLarge language models have proliferated across multiple domains in as short period of time. There is however hesitation in the medical and healthcare domain towards their adoption because of issues like factuality, coherence, and hallucinations. Give the high stakes nature of healthcare, many researchers have even cautioned against its usage until these issues are resolved. The key to the implementation and deployment of LLMs in healthcare is to make these models trustworthy, transparent (as much possible) and explainable. In this paper we describe the key elements in creating reliable, trustworthy, and unbiased models as a necessary condition for their adoption in healthcare. Specifically we focus on the quantification, validation, and mitigation of hallucinations in the context in healthcare. Lastly, we discuss how the future of LLMs in healthcare may look like.\n\n---------------\n\n### 24 May 2023 | Prompt Evolution for Generative AI: A Classifier-Guided Approach | ⬇️\nMelvin Wong, Yew-Soon Ong, Abhishek Gupta, Kavitesh K. Bali, Caishun Chen \n\nSynthesis of digital artifacts conditioned on user prompts has become an important paradigm facilitating an explosion of use cases with generative AI. However, such models often fail to connect the generated outputs and desired target concepts/preferences implied by the prompts. Current research addressing this limitation has largely focused on enhancing the prompts before output generation or improving the model's performance up front. In contrast, this paper conceptualizes prompt evolution, imparting evolutionary selection pressure and variation during the generative process to produce multiple outputs that satisfy the target concepts/preferences better. We propose a multi-objective instantiation of this broader idea that uses a multi-label image classifier-guided approach. The predicted labels from the classifiers serve as multiple objectives to optimize, with the aim of producing diversified images that meet user preferences. A novelty of our evolutionary algorithm is that the pre-trained generative model gives us implicit mutation operations, leveraging the model's stochastic generative capability to automate the creation of Pareto-optimized images more faithful to user preferences.\n\n---------------\n\n### 22 Jul 2020 | Analogical Reasoning for Visually Grounded Language Acquisition | ⬇️\nBo Wu, Haoyu Qin, Alireza Zareian, Carl Vondrick, Shih-Fu Chang \n\nChildren acquire language subconsciously by observing the surrounding world and listening to descriptions. They can discover the meaning of words even without explicit language knowledge, and generalize to novel compositions effortlessly. In this paper, we bring this ability to AI, by studying the task of Visually grounded Language Acquisition (VLA). We propose a multimodal transformer model augmented with a novel mechanism for analogical reasoning, which approximates novel compositions by learning semantic mapping and reasoning operations from previously seen compositions. Our proposed method, Analogical Reasoning Transformer Networks (ARTNet), is trained on raw multimedia data (video frames and transcripts), and after observing a set of compositions such as "washing apple" or "cutting carrot", it can generalize and recognize new compositions in new video frames, such as "washing carrot" or "cutting apple".

However, fake facial expressions are difficult to be recognized even by humans. On the other hand, facial micro-expressions generally represent the actual emotion of a person, as it is a spontaneous reaction expressed through human face. Despite of a few attempts made for recognizing micro-expressions, still the problem is far from being a solved problem, which is depicted by the poor rate of accuracy shown by the state-of-the-art methods. A few CNN based approaches are found in the literature to recognize micro-facial expressions from still images. Whereas, a spontaneous micro-expression video contains multiple frames that have to be processed together to encode both spatial and temporal information. This paper proposes two 3D-CNN methods: MicroExpSTCNN and MicroExpFuseNet, for spontaneous facial micro-expression recognition by exploiting the spatiotemporal information in CNN framework. The MicroExpSTCNN considers the full spatial information, whereas the MicroExpFuseNet is based on the 3D-CNN feature fusion of the eyes and mouth regions. The experiments are performed over CAS(ME)^2 and SMIC micro-expression databases. The proposed MicroExpSTCNN model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n---------------\n\n### 24 Nov 2017 | Interactive Robot Learning of Gestures, Language and Affordances | ⬇️\nGiovanni Saponaro, Lorenzo Jamone, Alexandre Bernardino, Giampiero Salvi \n\nA growing field in robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is human-robot collaboration, whose target is to enable effective teamwork between humans and robots. However, in many situations human teams are still superior to human-robot teams, primarily because human teams can easily agree on a common goal with language, and the individual members observe each other effectively, leveraging their shared motor repertoire and sensorimotor resources. This paper shows that for cognitive robots it is possible, and indeed fruitful, to combine knowledge acquired from interacting with elements of the environment (affordance exploration) with the probabilistic observation of another agent's actions. We propose a model that unites (i) learning robot affordances and word descriptions with (ii) statistical recognition of human gestures with vision sensors. We discuss theoretical motivations, possible implementations, and we show initial results which highlight that, after having acquired knowledge of its surrounding environment, a humanoid robot can generalize this knowledge to the case when it observes another agent (human partner) performing the same motor actions previously executed during training.\n\n---------------\n\n### 12 Mar 2024 | NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning | ⬇️\nBingqian Lin, Yunshuang Nie, Ziming Wei, Jiaqi Chen, Shikui Ma, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Xiaojun Chang, Xiaodan Liang \n\nVision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

Derpanis, Pavel Tokmakov \n\nThis paper studies the problem of concept-based interpretability of transformer representations for videos. Concretely, we seek to explain the decision-making process of video transformers based on high-level, spatiotemporal concepts that are automatically discovered. Prior research on concept-based interpretability has concentrated solely on image-level tasks. Comparatively, video models deal with the added temporal dimension, increasing complexity and posing challenges in identifying dynamic concepts over time. In this work, we systematically address these challenges by introducing the first Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm. To this end, we propose an efficient approach for unsupervised identification of units of video transformer representations - concepts, and ranking their importance to the output of a model. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable, revealing spatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstructured video models. Performing this analysis jointly over a diverse set of supervised and self-supervised representations, we discover that some of these mechanism are universal in video transformers. Finally, we demonstrate that VTCDcan be used to improve model performance for fine-grained tasks.\n\n---------------\n\n### 02 May 2022 | ComPhy: Compositional Physical Reasoning of Objects and Events from Videos | ⬇️\nZhenfang Chen, Kexin Yi, Yunzhu Li, Mingyu Ding, Antonio Torralba, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Chuang Gan \n\nObjects' motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their properties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object's visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual appearances, by introducing the Compositional Physical Reasoning (ComPhy) dataset. For a given set of objects, ComPhy includes few videos of them moving and interacting under different initial conditions. The model is evaluated based on its capability to unravel the compositional hidden properties, such as mass and charge, and use this knowledge to answer a set of questions posted on one of the videos. Evaluation results of several state-of-the-art video reasoning models on ComPhy show unsatisfactory performance as they fail to capture these hidden properties. We further propose an oracle neural-symbolic framework named Compositional Physics Learner (CPL), combining visual perception, physical property learning, dynamic prediction, and symbolic execution into a unified framework. CPL can effectively identify objects' physical properties from their interactions and predict their dynamics to answer questions.\n\n---------------\n\n### 01 Aug 2022 | PACS: A Dataset for Physical Audiovisual CommonSense Reasoning | ⬇️\nSamuel Yu, Peter Wu, Paul Pu Liang, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Louis-Philippe Morency \n\nIn order for AI to be safely deployed in real-world scenarios such as hospitals, schools, and the workplace, it must be able to robustly reason about the physical world. Fundamental to this reasoning is physical common sense: understanding the physical properties and affordances of available objects, how they can be manipulated, and how they interact with other objects. Physical commonsense reasoning is fundamentally a multi-sensory task, since physical properties are manifested through multiple modalities - two of them being vision and acoustics. Our paper takes a step towards real-world physical commonsense reasoning by contributing PACS: the first audiovisual benchmark annotated for physical commonsense attributes. PACS contains 13,400 question-answer pairs, involving 1,377 unique physical commonsense questions and 1,526 videos. Our dataset provides new opportunities to advance the research field of physical reasoning by bringing audio as a core component of this multimodal problem. Using PACS, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models on our new challenging task. While some models show promising results (70% accuracy), they all fall short of human performance (95% accuracy). We conclude the paper by demonstrating the importance of multimodal reasoning and providing possible avenues for future research.\n\n---------------\n\n### 19 Jun 2019 | PyRobot: An Open-source Robotics Framework for Research and Benchmarking | ⬇️\nAdithyavairavan Murali, Tao Chen, Kalyan Vasudev Alwala, Dhiraj Gandhi, Lerrel Pinto, Saurabh Gupta, Abhinav Gupta \n\nThis paper introduces PyRobot, an open-source robotics framework for research and benchmarking.

Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered, more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning (EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments, as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers real-world deployment.\n2. <b> Adaptive Prior Selection for Repertoire-based Online Adaptation in Robotics </b> \n Abstract: Repertoire-based learning is a data-efficient adaptation approach based on a two-step process in which (1) a large and diverse set of policies is learned in simulation, and (2) a planning or learning algorithm chooses the most appropriate policies according to the current situation (e.g., a damaged robot, a new object, etc.). In this paper, we relax the assumption of previous works that a single repertoire is enough for adaptation. Instead, we generate repertoires for many different situations (e.g., with a missing leg, on different floors, etc.) and let our algorithm selects the most useful prior. Our main contribution is an algorithm, APROL (Adaptive Prior selection for Repertoire-based Online Learning) to plan the next action by incorporating these priors when the robot has no information about the current situation. We evaluate APROL on two simulated tasks: (1) pushing unknown objects of various shapes and sizes with a robotic arm and (2) a goal reaching task with a damaged hexapod robot. We compare with "Reset-free Trial and Error" (RTE) and various single repertoire-based baselines. The results show that APROL solves both the tasks in less interaction time than the baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate APROL on a real, damaged hexapod that quickly learns to pick compensatory policies to reach a goal by avoiding obstacles in the path.\n3. <b> A Survey of AI Text-to-Image and AI Text-to-Video Generators </b> \n Abstract: Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generation models are revolutionary technologies that use deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create images and videos from textual descriptions.

The survey provides an overview of the existing literature as well as an analysis of the approaches used in various studies. It covers data preprocessing techniques, neural network types, and evaluation metrics used in the field. In addition, the paper discusses the challenges and limitations of Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generations, as well as future research directions. Overall, these models have promising potential for a wide range of applications such as video production, content creation, and digital marketing.\n4. <b> Affordances from Human Videos as a Versatile Representation for Robotics </b> \n Abstract: Building a robot that can understand and learn to interact by watching humans has inspired several vision problems. However, despite some successful results on static datasets, it remains unclear how current models can be used on a robot directly. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging videos of human interactions in an environment centric manner. Utilizing internet videos of human behavior, we train a visual affordance model that estimates where and how in the scene a human is likely to interact. The structure of these behavioral affordances directly enables the robot to perform many complex tasks. We show how to seamlessly integrate our affordance model with four robot learning paradigms including offline imitation learning, exploration, goal-conditioned learning, and action parameterization for reinforcement learning. We show the efficacy of our approach, which we call VRB, across 4 real world environments, over 10 different tasks, and 2 robotic platforms operating in the wild.

The creative sectors have always been early adopters of AI technologies and this continues to be the case. As a matter of fact, recent technological developments keep pushing the boundaries of intelligent systems in creative applications: the critically acclaimed movie "Sunspring", released in 2016, was entirely written by AI technology, and the first-ever Music Album, called "Hello World", produced using AI has been released this year. Simultaneously, the exploratory nature of the creative process is raising important technical challenges for AI such as the ability for AI-powered techniques to be accurate under limited data resources, as opposed to the conventional "Big Data" approach, or the ability to process, analyse and match data from multiple modalities (text, sound, images, etc.) at the same time. The purpose of this white paper is to understand future technological advances in AI and their growing impact on creative industries. This paper addresses the following questions: Where does AI operate in creative Industries? What is its operative role? How will AI transform creative industries in the next ten years? This white paper aims to provide a realistic perspective of the scope of AI actions in creative industries, proposes a vision of how this technology could contribute to research and development works in such context, and identifies research and development challenges.\n6. <b> Where are we in the search for an Artificial Visual Cortex for Embodied Intelligence? </b> \n Abstract: We present the largest and most comprehensive empirical study of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) or visual 'foundation models' for Embodied AI. First, we curate CortexBench, consisting of 17 different tasks spanning locomotion, navigation, dexterous, and mobile manipulation. Next, we systematically evaluate existing PVRs and find that none are universally dominant. To study the effect of pre-training data size and diversity, we combine over 4,000 hours of egocentric videos from 7 different sources (over 4.3M images) and ImageNet to train different-sized vision transformers using Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) on slices of this data. Contrary to inferences from prior work, we find that scaling dataset size and diversity does not improve performance universally (but does so on average). Our largest model, named VC-1, outperforms all prior PVRs on average but does not universally dominate either. Next, we show that task- or domain-specific adaptation of VC-1 leads to substantial gains, with VC-1 (adapted) achieving competitive or superior performance than the best known results on all of the benchmarks in CortexBench. Finally, we present real-world hardware experiments, in which VC-1 and VC-1 (adapted) outperform the strongest pre-existing PVR. Overall, this paper presents no new techniques but a rigorous systematic evaluation, a broad set of findings about PVRs (that in some cases, refute those made in narrow domains in prior work), and open-sourced code and models (that required over 10,000 GPU-hours to train) for the benefit of the research community.\n7. <b> From Neural Activations to Concepts: A Survey on Explaining Concepts in Neural Networks </b> \n Abstract: In this paper, we review recent approaches for explaining concepts in neural networks. Concepts can act as a natural link between learning and reasoning: once the concepts are identified that a neural learning system uses, one can integrate those concepts with a reasoning system for inference or use a reasoning system to act upon them to improve or enhance the learning system. On the other hand, knowledge can not only be extracted from neural networks but concept knowledge can also be inserted into neural network architectures. Since integrating learning and reasoning is at the core of neuro-symbolic AI, the insights gained from this survey can serve as an important step towards realizing neuro-symbolic AI based on explainable concepts.\n8. <b> Imagined Value Gradients: Model-Based Policy Optimization with Transferable Latent Dynamics Models </b> \n Abstract: Humans are masters at quickly learning many complex tasks, relying on an approximate understanding of the dynamics of their environments. In much the same way, we would like our learning agents to quickly adapt to new tasks. In this paper, we explore how model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) can facilitate transfer to new tasks. We develop an algorithm that learns an action-conditional, predictive model of expected future observations, rewards and values from which a policy can be derived by following the gradient of the estimated value along imagined trajectories. We show how robust policy optimization can be achieved in robot manipulation tasks even with approximate models that are learned directly from vision and proprioception. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in a transfer learning scenario, re-using previously learned models on tasks with different reward structures and visual distractors, and show a significant improvement in learning speed compared to strong off-policy baselines. Videos with results can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/ivg-corl19\n9. <b> Deep Tracking: Seeing Beyond Seeing Using Recurrent Neural Networks </b> \n Abstract: This paper presents to the best of our knowledge the first end-to-end object tracking approach which directly maps from raw sensor input to object tracks in sensor space without requiring any feature engineering or system identification in the form of plant or sensor models. Specifically, our system accepts a stream of raw sensor data at one end and, in real-time, produces an estimate of the entire environment state at the output including even occluded objects. We achieve this by framing the problem as a deep learning task and exploit sequence models in the form of recurrent neural networks to learn a mapping from sensor measurements to object tracks. In particular, we propose a learning method based on a form of input dropout which allows learning in an unsupervised manner, only based on raw, occluded sensor data without access to ground-truth annotations. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the task of tracking objects in 2D laser data -- as commonly encountered in robotics applications -- and show that it learns to track many dynamic objects despite occlusions and the presence of sensor noise.\n10. <b> Creating Trustworthy LLMs: Dealing with Hallucinations in Healthcare AI </b> \n Abstract: Large language models have proliferated across multiple domains in as short period of time. There is however hesitation in the medical and healthcare domain towards their adoption because of issues like factuality, coherence, and hallucinations. Give the high stakes nature of healthcare, many researchers have even cautioned against its usage until these issues are resolved. The key to the implementation and deployment of LLMs in healthcare is to make these models trustworthy, transparent (as much possible) and explainable. In this paper we describe the key elements in creating reliable, trustworthy, and unbiased models as a necessary condition for their adoption in healthcare. Specifically we focus on the quantification, validation, and mitigation of hallucinations in the context in healthcare. Lastly, we discuss how the future of LLMs in healthcare may look like.\n11. <b> Prompt Evolution for Generative AI: A Classifier-Guided Approach </b> \n Abstract: Synthesis of digital artifacts conditioned on user prompts has become an important paradigm facilitating an explosion of use cases with generative AI. However, such models often fail to connect the generated outputs and desired target concepts/preferences implied by the prompts. Current research addressing this limitation has largely focused on enhancing the prompts before output generation or improving the model's performance up front. In contrast, this paper conceptualizes prompt evolution, imparting evolutionary selection pressure and variation during the generative process to produce multiple outputs that satisfy the target concepts/preferences better. We propose a multi-objective instantiation of this broader idea that uses a multi-label image classifier-guided approach. The predicted labels from the classifiers serve as multiple objectives to optimize, with the aim of producing diversified images that meet user preferences. A novelty of our evolutionary algorithm is that the pre-trained generative model gives us implicit mutation operations, leveraging the model's stochastic generative capability to automate the creation of Pareto-optimized images more faithful to user preferences.\n12. <b> Analogical Reasoning for Visually Grounded Language Acquisition </b> \n Abstract: Children acquire language subconsciously by observing the surrounding world and listening to descriptions. They can discover the meaning of words even without explicit language knowledge, and generalize to novel compositions effortlessly. In this paper, we bring this ability to AI, by studying the task of Visually grounded Language Acquisition (VLA). We propose a multimodal transformer model augmented with a novel mechanism for analogical reasoning, which approximates novel compositions by learning semantic mapping and reasoning operations from previously seen compositions. Our proposed method, Analogical Reasoning Transformer Networks (ARTNet), is trained on raw multimedia data (video frames and transcripts), and after observing a set of compositions such as "washing apple" or "cutting carrot", it can generalize and recognize new compositions in new video frames, such as "washing carrot" or "cutting apple". To this end, ARTNet refers to relevant instances in the training data and uses their visual features and captions to establish analogies with the query image. Then it chooses the suitable verb and noun to create a new composition that describes the new image best. Extensive experiments on an instructional video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly better generalization capability and recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art transformer models.\n13. <b> Nahid: AI-based Algorithm for operating fully-automatic surgery </b> \n Abstract: In this paper, for the first time, a method is presented that can provide a fully automated surgery based on software and computer vision techniques.

In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning (EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments, as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers real-world deployment.\n\n---------------\n\n### 03 Mar 2020 | [Adaptive Prior Selection for Repertoire-based Online Adaptation in Robotics](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2019.00151) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07029v3)\n*Rituraj Kaushik, Pierre Desreumaux, Jean-Baptiste Mouret* \n\nRepertoire-based learning is a data-efficient adaptation approach based on a two-step process in which (1) a large and diverse set of policies is learned in simulation, and (2) a planning or learning algorithm chooses the most appropriate policies according to the current situation (e.g., a damaged robot, a new object, etc.). In this paper, we relax the assumption of previous works that a single repertoire is enough for adaptation. Instead, we generate repertoires for many different situations (e.g., with a missing leg, on different floors, etc.) and let our algorithm selects the most useful prior. Our main contribution is an algorithm, APROL (Adaptive Prior selection for Repertoire-based Online Learning) to plan the next action by incorporating these priors when the robot has no information about the current situation. We evaluate APROL on two simulated tasks: (1) pushing unknown objects of various shapes and sizes with a robotic arm and (2) a goal reaching task with a damaged hexapod robot. We compare with "Reset-free Trial and Error" (RTE) and various single repertoire-based baselines. The results show that APROL solves both the tasks in less interaction time than the baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate APROL on a real, damaged hexapod that quickly learns to pick compensatory policies to reach a goal by avoiding obstacles in the path.\n\n---------------\n\n### 10 Nov 2023 | [A Survey of AI Text-to-Image and AI Text-to-Video Generators](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/AIRC57904.2023.10303174) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06329v1)\n*Aditi Singh* \n\nText-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generation models are revolutionary technologies that use deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create images and videos from textual descriptions.

However, despite some successful results on static datasets, it remains unclear how current models can be used on a robot directly. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging videos of human interactions in an environment centric manner. Utilizing internet videos of human behavior, we train a visual affordance model that estimates where and how in the scene a human is likely to interact. The structure of these behavioral affordances directly enables the robot to perform many complex tasks. We show how to seamlessly integrate our affordance model with four robot learning paradigms including offline imitation learning, exploration, goal-conditioned learning, and action parameterization for reinforcement learning. We show the efficacy of our approach, which we call VRB, across 4 real world environments, over 10 different tasks, and 2 robotic platforms operating in the wild.

First, we curate CortexBench, consisting of 17 different tasks spanning locomotion, navigation, dexterous, and mobile manipulation. Next, we systematically evaluate existing PVRs and find that none are universally dominant. To study the effect of pre-training data size and diversity, we combine over 4,000 hours of egocentric videos from 7 different sources (over 4.3M images) and ImageNet to train different-sized vision transformers using Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) on slices of this data. Contrary to inferences from prior work, we find that scaling dataset size and diversity does not improve performance universally (but does so on average). Our largest model, named VC-1, outperforms all prior PVRs on average but does not universally dominate either. Next, we show that task- or domain-specific adaptation of VC-1 leads to substantial gains, with VC-1 (adapted) achieving competitive or superior performance than the best known results on all of the benchmarks in CortexBench. Finally, we present real-world hardware experiments, in which VC-1 and VC-1 (adapted) outperform the strongest pre-existing PVR. Overall, this paper presents no new techniques but a rigorous systematic evaluation, a broad set of findings about PVRs (that in some cases, refute those made in narrow domains in prior work), and open-sourced code and models (that required over 10,000 GPU-hours to train) for the benefit of the research community.\n\n---------------\n\n### 18 Oct 2023 | [From Neural Activations to Concepts: A Survey on Explaining Concepts in Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11884v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11884v1)\n*Jae Hee Lee, Sergio Lanza, Stefan Wermter* \n\nIn this paper, we review recent approaches for explaining concepts in neural networks. Concepts can act as a natural link between learning and reasoning: once the concepts are identified that a neural learning system uses, one can integrate those concepts with a reasoning system for inference or use a reasoning system to act upon them to improve or enhance the learning system. On the other hand, knowledge can not only be extracted from neural networks but concept knowledge can also be inserted into neural network architectures. Since integrating learning and reasoning is at the core of neuro-symbolic AI, the insights gained from this survey can serve as an important step towards realizing neuro-symbolic AI based on explainable concepts.\n\n---------------\n\n### 09 Oct 2019 | [Imagined Value Gradients: Model-Based Policy Optimization with Transferable Latent Dynamics Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04142v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04142v1)\n*Arunkumar Byravan, Jost Tobias Springenberg, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Roland Hafner, Michael Neunert, Thomas Lampe, Noah Siegel, Nicolas Heess, Martin Riedmiller* \n\nHumans are masters at quickly learning many complex tasks, relying on an approximate understanding of the dynamics of their environments. In much the same way, we would like our learning agents to quickly adapt to new tasks. In this paper, we explore how model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) can facilitate transfer to new tasks. We develop an algorithm that learns an action-conditional, predictive model of expected future observations, rewards and values from which a policy can be derived by following the gradient of the estimated value along imagined trajectories. We show how robust policy optimization can be achieved in robot manipulation tasks even with approximate models that are learned directly from vision and proprioception. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in a transfer learning scenario, re-using previously learned models on tasks with different reward structures and visual distractors, and show a significant improvement in learning speed compared to strong off-policy baselines.

Specifically, our system accepts a stream of raw sensor data at one end and, in real-time, produces an estimate of the entire environment state at the output including even occluded objects. We achieve this by framing the problem as a deep learning task and exploit sequence models in the form of recurrent neural networks to learn a mapping from sensor measurements to object tracks. In particular, we propose a learning method based on a form of input dropout which allows learning in an unsupervised manner, only based on raw, occluded sensor data without access to ground-truth annotations. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the task of tracking objects in 2D laser data -- as commonly encountered in robotics applications -- and show that it learns to track many dynamic objects despite occlusions and the presence of sensor noise.\n\n---------------\n\n### 26 Sep 2023 | [Creating Trustworthy LLMs: Dealing with Hallucinations in Healthcare AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01463v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01463v1)\n*Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad, Ilker Yaramis, Taposh Dutta Roy* \n\nLarge language models have proliferated across multiple domains in as short period of time. There is however hesitation in the medical and healthcare domain towards their adoption because of issues like factuality, coherence, and hallucinations. Give the high stakes nature of healthcare, many researchers have even cautioned against its usage until these issues are resolved. The key to the implementation and deployment of LLMs in healthcare is to make these models trustworthy, transparent (as much possible) and explainable. In this paper we describe the key elements in creating reliable, trustworthy, and unbiased models as a necessary condition for their adoption in healthcare. Specifically we focus on the quantification, validation, and mitigation of hallucinations in the context in healthcare. Lastly, we discuss how the future of LLMs in healthcare may look like.\n\n---------------\n\n### 24 May 2023 | [Prompt Evolution for Generative AI: A Classifier-Guided Approach](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CAI54212.2023.00105) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16347v1)\n*Melvin Wong, Yew-Soon Ong, Abhishek Gupta, Kavitesh K. Bali, Caishun Chen* \n\nSynthesis of digital artifacts conditioned on user prompts has become an important paradigm facilitating an explosion of use cases with generative AI. However, such models often fail to connect the generated outputs and desired target concepts/preferences implied by the prompts. Current research addressing this limitation has largely focused on enhancing the prompts before output generation or improving the model\'s performance up front. In contrast, this paper conceptualizes prompt evolution, imparting evolutionary selection pressure and variation during the generative process to produce multiple outputs that satisfy the target concepts/preferences better. We propose a multi-objective instantiation of this broader idea that uses a multi-label image classifier-guided approach. The predicted labels from the classifiers serve as multiple objectives to optimize, with the aim of producing diversified images that meet user preferences. A novelty of our evolutionary algorithm is that the pre-trained generative model gives us implicit mutation operations, leveraging the model\'s stochastic generative capability to automate the creation of Pareto-optimized images more faithful to user preferences.\n\n---------------\n\n### 22 Jul 2020 | [Analogical Reasoning for Visually Grounded Language Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11668v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11668v1)\n*Bo Wu, Haoyu Qin, Alireza Zareian, Carl Vondrick, Shih-Fu Chang* \n\nChildren acquire language subconsciously by observing the surrounding world and listening to descriptions. They can discover the meaning of words even without explicit language knowledge, and generalize to novel compositions effortlessly. In this paper, we bring this ability to AI, by studying the task of Visually grounded Language Acquisition (VLA). We propose a multimodal transformer model augmented with a novel mechanism for analogical reasoning, which approximates novel compositions by learning semantic mapping and reasoning operations from previously seen compositions. Our proposed method, Analogical Reasoning Transformer Networks (ARTNet), is trained on raw multimedia data (video frames and transcripts), and after observing a set of compositions such as "washing apple" or "cutting carrot", it can generalize and recognize new compositions in new video frames, such as "washing carrot" or "cutting apple". To this end, ARTNet refers to relevant instances in the training data and uses their visual features and captions to establish analogies with the query image. Then it chooses the suitable verb and noun to create a new composition that describes the new image best. Extensive experiments on an instructional video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly better generalization capability and recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art transformer models.\n\n---------------\n\n### 03 Nov 2023 | [Nahid: AI-based Algorithm for operating fully-automatic surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08584v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08584v1)\n*Sina Saadati* \n\nIn this paper, for the first time, a method is presented that can provide a fully automated surgery based on software and computer vision techniques.

However, fake facial expressions are difficult to be recognized even by humans. On the other hand, facial micro-expressions generally represent the actual emotion of a person, as it is a spontaneous reaction expressed through human face. Despite of a few attempts made for recognizing micro-expressions, still the problem is far from being a solved problem, which is depicted by the poor rate of accuracy shown by the state-of-the-art methods. A few CNN based approaches are found in the literature to recognize micro-facial expressions from still images. Whereas, a spontaneous micro-expression video contains multiple frames that have to be processed together to encode both spatial and temporal information. This paper proposes two 3D-CNN methods: MicroExpSTCNN and MicroExpFuseNet, for spontaneous facial micro-expression recognition by exploiting the spatiotemporal information in CNN framework. The MicroExpSTCNN considers the full spatial information, whereas the MicroExpFuseNet is based on the 3D-CNN feature fusion of the eyes and mouth regions. The experiments are performed over CAS(ME)^2 and SMIC micro-expression databases. The proposed MicroExpSTCNN model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n---------------\n\n### 24 Nov 2017 | [Interactive Robot Learning of Gestures, Language and Affordances](http://dx.doi.org/10.21437/GLU.2017-17) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09055v1)\n*Giovanni Saponaro, Lorenzo Jamone, Alexandre Bernardino, Giampiero Salvi* \n\nA growing field in robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is human-robot collaboration, whose target is to enable effective teamwork between humans and robots. However, in many situations human teams are still superior to human-robot teams, primarily because human teams can easily agree on a common goal with language, and the individual members observe each other effectively, leveraging their shared motor repertoire and sensorimotor resources. This paper shows that for cognitive robots it is possible, and indeed fruitful, to combine knowledge acquired from interacting with elements of the environment (affordance exploration) with the probabilistic observation of another agent\'s actions.   We propose a model that unites (i) learning robot affordances and word descriptions with (ii) statistical recognition of human gestures with vision sensors. We discuss theoretical motivations, possible implementations, and we show initial results which highlight that, after having acquired knowledge of its surrounding environment, a humanoid robot can generalize this knowledge to the case when it observes another agent (human partner) performing the same motor actions previously executed during training.\n\n---------------\n\n### 12 Mar 2024 | [NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07376v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07376v1)\n*Bingqian Lin, Yunshuang Nie, Ziming Wei, Jiaqi Chen, Shikui Ma, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Xiaojun Chang, Xiaodan Liang* \n\nVision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

Derpanis, Pavel Tokmakov* \n\nThis paper studies the problem of concept-based interpretability of transformer representations for videos. Concretely, we seek to explain the decision-making process of video transformers based on high-level, spatiotemporal concepts that are automatically discovered. Prior research on concept-based interpretability has concentrated solely on image-level tasks. Comparatively, video models deal with the added temporal dimension, increasing complexity and posing challenges in identifying dynamic concepts over time. In this work, we systematically address these challenges by introducing the first Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm. To this end, we propose an efficient approach for unsupervised identification of units of video transformer representations - concepts, and ranking their importance to the output of a model. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable, revealing spatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstructured video models. Performing this analysis jointly over a diverse set of supervised and self-supervised representations, we discover that some of these mechanism are universal in video transformers. Finally, we demonstrate that VTCDcan be used to improve model performance for fine-grained tasks.\n\n---------------\n\n### 02 May 2022 | [ComPhy: Compositional Physical Reasoning of Objects and Events from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01089v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.01089v1)\n*Zhenfang Chen, Kexin Yi, Yunzhu Li, Mingyu Ding, Antonio Torralba, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Chuang Gan* \n\nObjects\' motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their properties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object\'s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual appearances, by introducing the Compositional Physical Reasoning (ComPhy) dataset. For a given set of objects, ComPhy includes few videos of them moving and interacting under different initial conditions. The model is evaluated based on its capability to unravel the compositional hidden properties, such as mass and charge, and use this knowledge to answer a set of questions posted on one of the videos. Evaluation results of several state-of-the-art video reasoning models on ComPhy show unsatisfactory performance as they fail to capture these hidden properties. We further propose an oracle neural-symbolic framework named Compositional Physics Learner (CPL), combining visual perception, physical property learning, dynamic prediction, and symbolic execution into a unified framework. CPL can effectively identify objects\' physical properties from their interactions and predict their dynamics to answer questions.\n\n---------------\n\n### 01 Aug 2022 | [PACS: A Dataset for Physical Audiovisual CommonSense Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11130v3) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11130v3)\n*Samuel Yu, Peter Wu, Paul Pu Liang, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Louis-Philippe Morency* \n\nIn order for AI to be safely deployed in real-world scenarios such as hospitals, schools, and the workplace, it must be able to robustly reason about the physical world. Fundamental to this reasoning is physical common sense: understanding the physical properties and affordances of available objects, how they can be manipulated, and how they interact with other objects. Physical commonsense reasoning is fundamentally a multi-sensory task, since physical properties are manifested through multiple modalities - two of them being vision and acoustics. Our paper takes a step towards real-world physical commonsense reasoning by contributing PACS: the first audiovisual benchmark annotated for physical commonsense attributes. PACS contains 13,400 question-answer pairs, involving 1,377 unique physical commonsense questions and 1,526 videos. Our dataset provides new opportunities to advance the research field of physical reasoning by bringing audio as a core component of this multimodal problem. Using PACS, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models on our new challenging task. While some models show promising results (70% accuracy), they all fall short of human performance (95% accuracy). We conclude the paper by demonstrating the importance of multimodal reasoning and providing possible avenues for future research.\n\n---------------\n\n### 19 Jun 2019 | [PyRobot: An Open-source Robotics Framework for Research and Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08236v1) | [⬇️](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08236v1)\n*Adithyavairavan Murali, Tao Chen, Kalyan Vasudev Alwala, Dhiraj Gandhi, Lerrel Pinto, Saurabh Gupta, Abhinav Gupta* \n\nThis paper introduces PyRobot, an open-source robotics framework for research and benchmarking.

The purpose of this white paper is to understand future technological advances in AI and their growing impact on creative industries. This paper addresses the following questions: Where does AI operate in creative Industries? What is its operative role? How will AI transform creative industries in the next ten years? This white paper aims to provide a realistic perspective of the scope of AI actions in creative industries, proposes a vision of how this technology could contribute to research and development works in such context, and identifies research and development challenges.\n6. <b> Where are we in the search for an Artificial Visual Cortex for Embodied Intelligence? </b> \n Abstract: We present the largest and most comprehensive empirical study of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) or visual \'foundation models\' for Embodied AI. First, we curate CortexBench, consisting of 17 different tasks spanning locomotion, navigation, dexterous, and mobile manipulation. Next, we systematically evaluate existing PVRs and find that none are universally dominant. To study the effect of pre-training data size and diversity, we combine over 4,000 hours of egocentric videos from 7 different sources (over 4.3M images) and ImageNet to train different-sized vision transformers using Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) on slices of this data. Contrary to inferences from prior work, we find that scaling dataset size and diversity does not improve performance universally (but does so on average). Our largest model, named VC-1, outperforms all prior PVRs on average but does not universally dominate either. Next, we show that task- or domain-specific adaptation of VC-1 leads to substantial gains, with VC-1 (adapted) achieving competitive or superior performance than the best known results on all of the benchmarks in CortexBench. Finally, we present real-world hardware experiments, in which VC-1 and VC-1 (adapted) outperform the strongest pre-existing PVR. Overall, this paper presents no new techniques but a rigorous systematic evaluation, a broad set of findings about PVRs (that in some cases, refute those made in narrow domains in prior work), and open-sourced code and models (that required over 10,000 GPU-hours to train) for the benefit of the research community.\n7. <b> From Neural Activations to Concepts: A Survey on Explaining Concepts in Neural Networks </b> \n Abstract: In this paper, we review recent approaches for explaining concepts in neural networks. Concepts can act as a natural link between learning and reasoning: once the concepts are identified that a neural learning system uses, one can integrate those concepts with a reasoning system for inference or use a reasoning system to act upon them to improve or enhance the learning system. On the other hand, knowledge can not only be extracted from neural networks but concept knowledge can also be inserted into neural network architectures. Since integrating learning and reasoning is at the core of neuro-symbolic AI, the insights gained from this survey can serve as an important step towards realizing neuro-symbolic AI based on explainable concepts.\n8. <b> Imagined Value Gradients: Model-Based Policy Optimization with Transferable Latent Dynamics Models </b> \n Abstract: Humans are masters at quickly learning many complex tasks, relying on an approximate understanding of the dynamics of their environments. In much the same way, we would like our learning agents to quickly adapt to new tasks. In this paper, we explore how model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) can facilitate transfer to new tasks. We develop an algorithm that learns an action-conditional, predictive model of expected future observations, rewards and values from which a policy can be derived by following the gradient of the estimated value along imagined trajectories. We show how robust policy optimization can be achieved in robot manipulation tasks even with approximate models that are learned directly from vision and proprioception. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in a transfer learning scenario, re-using previously learned models on tasks with different reward structures and visual distractors, and show a significant improvement in learning speed compared to strong off-policy baselines. Videos with results can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/ivg-corl19\n9. <b> Deep Tracking: Seeing Beyond Seeing Using Recurrent Neural Networks </b> \n Abstract: This paper presents to the best of our knowledge the first end-to-end object tracking approach which directly maps from raw sensor input to object tracks in sensor space without requiring any feature engineering or system identification in the form of plant or sensor models. Specifically, our system accepts a stream of raw sensor data at one end and, in real-time, produces an estimate of the entire environment state at the output including even occluded objects. We achieve this by framing the problem as a deep learning task and exploit sequence models in the form of recurrent neural networks to learn a mapping from sensor measurements to object tracks. In particular, we propose a learning method based on a form of input dropout which allows learning in an unsupervised manner, only based on raw, occluded sensor data without access to ground-truth annotations. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the task of tracking objects in 2D laser data -- as commonly encountered in robotics applications -- and show that it learns to track many dynamic objects despite occlusions and the presence of sensor noise.\n10. <b> Creating Trustworthy LLMs: Dealing with Hallucinations in Healthcare AI </b> \n Abstract: Large language models have proliferated across multiple domains in as short period of time. There is however hesitation in the medical and healthcare domain towards their adoption because of issues like factuality, coherence, and hallucinations. Give the high stakes nature of healthcare, many researchers have even cautioned against its usage until these issues are resolved. The key to the implementation and deployment of LLMs in healthcare is to make these models trustworthy, transparent (as much possible) and explainable. In this paper we describe the key elements in creating reliable, trustworthy, and unbiased models as a necessary condition for their adoption in healthcare. Specifically we focus on the quantification, validation, and mitigation of hallucinations in the context in healthcare. Lastly, we discuss how the future of LLMs in healthcare may look like.\n11. <b> Prompt Evolution for Generative AI: A Classifier-Guided Approach </b> \n Abstract: Synthesis of digital artifacts conditioned on user prompts has become an important paradigm facilitating an explosion of use cases with generative AI. However, such models often fail to connect the generated outputs and desired target concepts/preferences implied by the prompts. Current research addressing this limitation has largely focused on enhancing the prompts before output generation or improving the model\'s performance up front. In contrast, this paper conceptualizes prompt evolution, imparting evolutionary selection pressure and variation during the generative process to produce multiple outputs that satisfy the target concepts/preferences better. We propose a multi-objective instantiation of this broader idea that uses a multi-label image classifier-guided approach. The predicted labels from the classifiers serve as multiple objectives to optimize, with the aim of producing diversified images that meet user preferences. A novelty of our evolutionary algorithm is that the pre-trained generative model gives us implicit mutation operations, leveraging the model\'s stochastic generative capability to automate the creation of Pareto-optimized images more faithful to user preferences.\n12. <b> Analogical Reasoning for Visually Grounded Language Acquisition </b> \n Abstract: Children acquire language subconsciously by observing the surrounding world and listening to descriptions. They can discover the meaning of words even without explicit language knowledge, and generalize to novel compositions effortlessly. In this paper, we bring this ability to AI, by studying the task of Visually grounded Language Acquisition (VLA). We propose a multimodal transformer model augmented with a novel mechanism for analogical reasoning, which approximates novel compositions by learning semantic mapping and reasoning operations from previously seen compositions. Our proposed method, Analogical Reasoning Transformer Networks (ARTNet), is trained on raw multimedia data (video frames and transcripts), and after observing a set of compositions such as "washing apple" or "cutting carrot", it can generalize and recognize new compositions in new video frames, such as "washing carrot" or "cutting apple". To this end, ARTNet refers to relevant instances in the training data and uses their visual features and captions to establish analogies with the query image. Then it chooses the suitable verb and noun to create a new composition that describes the new image best. Extensive experiments on an instructional video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly better generalization capability and recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art transformer models.\n13. <b> Nahid: AI-based Algorithm for operating fully-automatic surgery </b> \n Abstract: In this paper, for the first time, a method is presented that can provide a fully automated surgery based on software and computer vision techniques. Then, the advantages and challenges of computerization of medical surgery are examined. Finally, the surgery related to isolated ovarian endometriosis disease has been examined, and based on the presented method, a more detailed algorithm is presented that is capable of automatically diagnosing and treating this disease during surgery as proof of our proposed method where a U-net is trained to detect the endometriosis during surgery.\n14. <b> Spontaneous Facial Micro-Expression Recognition using 3D Spatiotemporal Convolutional Neural Networks </b> \n Abstract: Facial expression recognition in videos is an active area of research in computer vision. However, fake facial expressions are difficult to be recognized even by humans. On the other hand, facial micro-expressions generally represent the actual emotion of a person, as it is a spontaneous reaction expressed through human face. Despite of a few attempts made for recognizing micro-expressions, still the problem is far from being a solved problem, which is depicted by the poor rate of accuracy shown by the state-of-the-art methods. A few CNN based approaches are found in the literature to recognize micro-facial expressions from still images. Whereas, a spontaneous micro-expression video contains multiple frames that have to be processed together to encode both spatial and temporal information. This paper proposes two 3D-CNN methods: MicroExpSTCNN and MicroExpFuseNet, for spontaneous facial micro-expression recognition by exploiting the spatiotemporal information in CNN framework. The MicroExpSTCNN considers the full spatial information, whereas the MicroExpFuseNet is based on the 3D-CNN feature fusion of the eyes and mouth regions. The experiments are performed over CAS(ME)^2 and SMIC micro-expression databases. The proposed MicroExpSTCNN model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n15. <b> Interactive Robot Learning of Gestures, Language and Affordances </b> \n Abstract: A growing field in robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is human-robot collaboration, whose target is to enable effective teamwork between humans and robots. However, in many situations human teams are still superior to human-robot teams, primarily because human teams can easily agree on a common goal with language, and the individual members observe each other effectively, leveraging their shared motor repertoire and sensorimotor resources. This paper shows that for cognitive robots it is possible, and indeed fruitful, to combine knowledge acquired from interacting with elements of the environment (affordance exploration) with the probabilistic observation of another agent\'s actions.   We propose a model that unites (i) learning robot affordances and word descriptions with (ii) statistical recognition of human gestures with vision sensors. We discuss theoretical motivations, possible implementations, and we show initial results which highlight that, after having acquired knowledge of its surrounding environment, a humanoid robot can generalize this knowledge to the case when it observes another agent (human partner) performing the same motor actions previously executed during training.\n16. <b> NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning </b> \n Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/NavCoT.\n17. <b> Understanding Video Transformers via Universal Concept Discovery </b> \n Abstract: This paper studies the problem of concept-based interpretability of transformer representations for videos. Concretely, we seek to explain the decision-making process of video transformers based on high-level, spatiotemporal concepts that are automatically discovered. Prior research on concept-based interpretability has concentrated solely on image-level tasks. Comparatively, video models deal with the added temporal dimension, increasing complexity and posing challenges in identifying dynamic concepts over time. In this work, we systematically address these challenges by introducing the first Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm. To this end, we propose an efficient approach for unsupervised identification of units of video transformer representations - concepts, and ranking their importance to the output of a model. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable, revealing spatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstructured video models. Performing this analysis jointly over a diverse set of supervised and self-supervised representations, we discover that some of these mechanism are universal in video transformers. Finally, we demonstrate that VTCDcan be used to improve model performance for fine-grained tasks.\n18. <b> ComPhy: Compositional Physical Reasoning of Objects and Events from Videos </b> \n Abstract: Objects\' motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their properties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object\'s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual appearances, by introducing the Compositional Physical Reasoning (ComPhy) dataset. For a given set of objects, ComPhy includes few videos of them moving and interacting under different initial conditions. The model is evaluated based on its capability to unravel the compositional hidden properties, such as mass and charge, and use this knowledge to answer a set of questions posted on one of the videos. Evaluation results of several state-of-the-art video reasoning models on ComPhy show unsatisfactory performance as they fail to capture these hidden properties. We further propose an oracle neural-symbolic framework named Compositional Physics Learner (CPL), combining visual perception, physical property learning, dynamic prediction, and symbolic execution into a unified framework. CPL can effectively identify objects\' physical properties from their interactions and predict their dynamics to answer questions.\n19. <b> PACS: A Dataset for Physical Audiovisual CommonSense Reasoning </b> \n Abstract: In order for AI to be safely deployed in real-world scenarios such as hospitals, schools, and the workplace, it must be able to robustly reason about the physical world. Fundamental to this reasoning is physical common sense: understanding the physical properties and affordances of available objects, how they can be manipulated, and how they interact with other objects. Physical commonsense reasoning is fundamentally a multi-sensory task, since physical properties are manifested through multiple modalities - two of them being vision and acoustics. Our paper takes a step towards real-world physical commonsense reasoning by contributing PACS: the first audiovisual benchmark annotated for physical commonsense attributes. PACS contains 13,400 question-answer pairs, involving 1,377 unique physical commonsense questions and 1,526 videos. Our dataset provides new opportunities to advance the research field of physical reasoning by bringing audio as a core component of this multimodal problem. Using PACS, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models on our new challenging task. While some models show promising results (70% accuracy), they all fall short of human performance (95% accuracy). We conclude the paper by demonstrating the importance of multimodal reasoning and providing possible avenues for future research.\n20. <b> PyRobot: An Open-source Robotics Framework for Research and Benchmarking </b> \n Abstract: This paper introduces PyRobot, an open-source robotics framework for research and benchmarking. PyRobot is a light-weight, high-level interface on top of ROS that provides a consistent set of hardware independent mid-level APIs to control different robots. PyRobot abstracts away details about low-level controllers and inter-process communication, and allows non-robotics researchers (ML, CV researchers) to focus on building high-level AI applications. PyRobot aims to provide a research ecosystem with convenient access to robotics datasets, algorithm implementations and models that can be used to quickly create a state-of-the-art baseline. We believe PyRobot, when paired up with low-cost robot platforms such as LoCoBot, will reduce the entry barrier into robotics, and democratize robotics. PyRobot is open-source, and can be accessed via https://pyrobot.org.\n \n Given the following scientific paper abstracts, take a deep breath and lets think step by step to answer the question.

Large Language Models (LLM) are good at leveraging public data\non standard problems but once you want to tackle more specific complex\nquestions or problems (e.g. How does the concept of personal freedom vary\nbetween different cultures ? What is the best mix of power generation methods\nto reduce climate change ?) you may need specific architecture, knowledge,\nskills, methods, sensitive data protection, explainability, human approval and\nversatile feedback... Recent projects like ChatGPT and GALACTICA have allowed\nnon-specialists to grasp the great potential as well as the equally strong\nlimitations of LLM in complex QA. In this paper, we start by reviewing required\nskills and evaluation techniques. We integrate findings from the robust\ncommunity edited research papers BIG, BLOOM and HELM which open source,\nbenchmark and analyze limits and challenges of LLM in terms of tasks complexity\nand strict evaluation on accuracy (e.g. fairness, robustness, toxicity, ...) as\na baseline. We discuss some challenges associated with complex QA, including\ndomain adaptation, decomposition and efficient multi-step QA, long form and\nnon-factoid QA, safety and multi-sensitivity data protection, multimodal\nsearch, hallucinations, explainability and truthfulness, temporal reasoning. We\nanalyze current solutions and promising research trends, using elements such\nas: hybrid LLM architectural patterns, training and prompting strategies,\nactive human reinforcement learning supervised with AI, neuro-symbolic and\nstructured knowledge grounding, program synthesis, iterated decomposition and\nothers.\n\n---------------\n\n### 05 Mar 2024 | Entropy-Regularized Token-Level Policy Optimization for Large Language Models | ⬇️\nMuning Wen, Cheng Deng, Jun Wang, Weinan Zhang and Ying Wen \n\n Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as intelligent agents in\ninteractive decision-making tasks. Traditional approaches often depend on\nmeticulously designed prompts, high-quality examples, or additional reward\nmodels for in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, or RLHF. Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) presents a dynamic alternative for LLMs to overcome these\ndependencies by engaging directly with task-specific environments. Nonetheless,\nit faces significant hurdles: 1) instability stemming from the exponentially\nvast action space requiring exploration; 2) challenges in assigning token-level\ncredit based on action-level reward signals, resulting in discord between\nmaximizing rewards and accurately modeling corpus data. In response to these\nchallenges, we introduce Entropy-Regularized Token-level Policy Optimization\n(ETPO), an entropy-augmented RL method tailored for optimizing LLMs at the\ntoken level. At the heart of ETPO is our novel per-token soft Bellman update,\ndesigned to harmonize the RL process with the principles of language modeling.\nThis methodology decomposes the Q-function update from a coarse action-level\nview to a more granular token-level perspective, backed by theoretical proof of\noptimization consistency. Crucially, this decomposition renders linear time\ncomplexity in action exploration. We assess the effectiveness of ETPO within a\nsimulated environment that models data science code generation as a series of\nmulti-step interactive tasks; results show that ETPO achieves effective\nperformance improvement on the CodeLlama-7B model and surpasses a variant PPO\nbaseline inherited from RLHF. This underlines ETPO's potential as a robust\nmethod for refining the interactive decision-making capabilities of LLMs. Our\ncode is open-sourced at https://github.com/morning9393/ETPO.\n\n---------------\n\n### 11 Oct 2023 | ClausewitzGPT Framework: A New Frontier in Theoretical Large Language Model Enhanced Information Operations | ⬇️\nBenjamin Kereopa-Yorke \n\n In a digital epoch where cyberspace is the emerging nexus of geopolitical\ncontention, the melding of information operations and Large Language Models\n(LLMs) heralds a paradigm shift, replete with immense opportunities and\nintricate challenges. As tools like the Mistral 7B LLM (Mistral, 2023)\ndemocratise access to LLM capabilities (Jin et al., 2023), a vast spectrum of\nactors, from sovereign nations to rogue entities (Howard et al., 2023), find\nthemselves equipped with potent narrative-shaping instruments (Goldstein et\nal., 2023). This paper puts forth a framework for navigating this brave new\nworld in the "ClausewitzGPT" equation. This novel formulation not only seeks to\nquantify the risks inherent in machine-speed LLM-augmented operations but also\nunderscores the vital role of autonomous AI agents (Wang, Xie, et al., 2023).\nThese agents, embodying ethical considerations (Hendrycks et al., 2021), emerge\nas indispensable components (Wang, Ma, et al., 2023), ensuring that as we race\nforward, we do not lose sight of moral compasses and societal imperatives.\n Mathematically underpinned and inspired by the timeless tenets of\nClausewitz's military strategy (Clausewitz, 1832), this thesis delves into the\nintricate dynamics of AI-augmented information operations. With references to\nrecent findings and research (Department of State, 2023), it highlights the\nstaggering year-on-year growth of AI information campaigns (Evgeny Pashentsev,\n2023), stressing the urgency of our current juncture. The synthesis of\nEnlightenment thinking, and Clausewitz's principles provides a foundational\nlens, emphasising the imperative of clear strategic vision, ethical\nconsiderations, and holistic understanding in the face of rapid technological\nadvancement.\n\n---------------\n\n### 25 Oct 2022 | Learning to Act with Affordance-Aware Multimodal Neural SLAM | ⬇️\nZhiwei Jia, Kaixiang Lin, Yizhou Zhao, Qiaozi Gao, Govind Thattai, Gaurav Sukhatme \n\n Recent years have witnessed an emerging paradigm shift toward embodied\nartificial intelligence, in which an agent must learn to solve challenging\ntasks by interacting with its environment. There are several challenges in\nsolving embodied multimodal tasks, including long-horizon planning,\nvision-and-language grounding, and efficient exploration. We focus on a\ncritical bottleneck, namely the performance of planning and navigation. To\ntackle this challenge, we propose a Neural SLAM approach that, for the first\ntime, utilizes several modalities for exploration, predicts an affordance-aware\nsemantic map, and plans over it at the same time. This significantly improves\nexploration efficiency, leads to robust long-horizon planning, and enables\neffective vision-and-language grounding. With the proposed Affordance-aware\nMultimodal Neural SLAM (AMSLAM) approach, we obtain more than 40% improvement\nover prior published work on the ALFRED benchmark and set a new\nstate-of-the-art generalization performance at a success rate of 23.48% on the\ntest unseen scenes.\n\n---------------\n\n### 31 Oct 2023 | Large-scale Multi-Modal Pre-trained Models: A Comprehensive Survey | ⬇️\nXiao Wang, Guangyao Chen, Guangwu Qian, Pengcheng Gao, Xiao-Yong Wei, Yaowei Wang, Yonghong Tian, Wen Gao \n\n With the urgent demand for generalized deep models, many pre-trained big\nmodels are proposed, such as BERT, ViT, GPT, etc. Inspired by the success of\nthese models in single domains (like computer vision and natural language\nprocessing), the multi-modal pre-trained big models have also drawn more and\nmore attention in recent years. In this work, we give a comprehensive survey of\nthese models and hope this paper could provide new insights and helps fresh\nresearchers to track the most cutting-edge works. Specifically, we firstly\nintroduce the background of multi-modal pre-training by reviewing the\nconventional deep learning, pre-training works in natural language process,\ncomputer vision, and speech. Then, we introduce the task definition, key\nchallenges, and advantages of multi-modal pre-training models (MM-PTMs), and\ndiscuss the MM-PTMs with a focus on data, objectives, network architectures,\nand knowledge enhanced pre-training. After that, we introduce the downstream\ntasks used for the validation of large-scale MM-PTMs, including generative,\nclassification, and regression tasks. We also give visualization and analysis\nof the model parameters and results on representative downstream tasks.\nFinally, we point out possible research directions for this topic that may\nbenefit future works.

These tasks often involve complex multi-step reasoning, presenting\nsignificant challenges due to the limited paired data connecting human\ninstructions (e.g., making a smiley face) and robot actions (e.g., end-effector\nmovement). Existing approaches relieve this challenge by adopting an open-loop\nparadigm decomposing high-level instructions into simple sub-task plans, and\nexecuting them step-by-step using low-level control models. However, these\napproaches are short of instant observations in multi-step reasoning, leading\nto sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose to automatically\ncollect a cognitive robot dataset by Large Language Models (LLMs). The\nresulting dataset AlphaBlock consists of 35 comprehensive high-level tasks of\nmulti-step text plans and paired observation sequences. To enable efficient\ndata acquisition, we employ elaborated multi-round prompt designs that\neffectively reduce the burden of extensive human involvement. We further\npropose a closed-loop multi-modal embodied planning model that autoregressively\ngenerates plans by taking image observations as input. To facilitate effective\nlearning, we leverage MiniGPT-4 with a frozen visual encoder and LLM, and\nfinetune additional vision adapter and Q-former to enable fine-grained spatial\nperception for manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments to verify the\nsuperiority over existing open and closed-loop methods, and achieve a\nsignificant increase in success rate by 21.4% and 14.5% over ChatGPT and GPT-4\nbased robot tasks.

This issue of\nhallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these\npowerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.\nThe journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily\nrelies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI\nsystems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of\nonline text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive\nlanguage fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information\nfrom the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or\nmodifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes\nhugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive\napplications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports,\netc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed\nto mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023),\nCoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we\nintroduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various\nparameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and\nretriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches\nspecifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we\nanalyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing\na solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related\nphenomena within the realm of LLMs.\n\n---------------\n\n### 01 Mar 2024 | Multimodality Representation Learning: A Survey on Evolution, Pretraining and Its Applications | ⬇️\nMuhammad Arslan Manzoor, Sarah Albarri, Ziting Xian, Zaiqiao Meng, Preslav Nakov, and Shangsong Liang \n\n Multimodality Representation Learning, as a technique of learning to embed\ninformation from different modalities and their correlations, has achieved\nremarkable success on a variety of applications, such as Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA), Natural Language for Visual Reasoning (NLVR), and Vision\nLanguage Retrieval (VLR). Among these applications, cross-modal interaction and\ncomplementary information from different modalities are crucial for advanced\nmodels to perform any multimodal task, e.g., understand, recognize, retrieve,\nor generate optimally. Researchers have proposed diverse methods to address\nthese tasks. The different variants of transformer-based architectures\nperformed extraordinarily on multiple modalities. This survey presents the\ncomprehensive literature on the evolution and enhancement of deep learning\nmultimodal architectures to deal with textual, visual and audio features for\ndiverse cross-modal and modern multimodal tasks. This study summarizes the (i)\nrecent task-specific deep learning methodologies, (ii) the pretraining types\nand multimodal pretraining objectives, (iii) from state-of-the-art pretrained\nmultimodal approaches to unifying architectures, and (iv) multimodal task\ncategories and possible future improvements that can be devised for better\nmultimodal learning. Moreover, we prepare a dataset section for new researchers\nthat covers most of the benchmarks for pretraining and finetuning. Finally,\nmajor challenges, gaps, and potential research topics are explored. A\nconstantly-updated paperlist related to our survey is maintained at\nhttps://github.com/marslanm/multimodality-representation-learning.\n\n---------------\n\n### 14 Jun 2022 | ProcTHOR: Large-Scale Embodied AI Using Procedural Generation | ⬇️\nMatt Deitke, Eli VanderBilt, Alvaro Herrasti, Luca Weihs, Jordi Salvador, Kiana Ehsani, Winson Han, Eric Kolve, Ali Farhadi, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Roozbeh Mottaghi \n\n Massive datasets and high-capacity models have driven many recent\nadvancements in computer vision and natural language understanding. This work\npresents a platform to enable similar success stories in Embodied AI. We\npropose ProcTHOR, a framework for procedural generation of Embodied AI\nenvironments. ProcTHOR enables us to sample arbitrarily large datasets of\ndiverse, interactive, customizable, and performant virtual environments to\ntrain and evaluate embodied agents across navigation, interaction, and\nmanipulation tasks. We demonstrate the power and potential of ProcTHOR via a\nsample of 10,000 generated houses and a simple neural model. Models trained\nusing only RGB images on ProcTHOR, with no explicit mapping and no human task\nsupervision produce state-of-the-art results across 6 embodied AI benchmarks\nfor navigation, rearrangement, and arm manipulation, including the presently\nrunning Habitat 2022, AI2-THOR Rearrangement 2022, and RoboTHOR challenges. We\nalso demonstrate strong 0-shot results on these benchmarks, via pre-training on\nProcTHOR with no fine-tuning on the downstream benchmark, often beating\nprevious state-of-the-art systems that access the downstream training data.\n\n---------------\n\n### 02 Dec 2023 | Planning as In-Painting: A Diffusion-Based Embodied Task Planning Framework for Environments under Uncertainty | ⬇️\nCheng-Fu Yang, Haoyang Xu, Te-Lin Wu, Xiaofeng Gao, Kai-Wei Chang, Feng Gao \n\n Task planning for embodied AI has been one of the most challenging problems\nwhere the community does not meet a consensus in terms of formulation. In this\npaper, we aim to tackle this problem with a unified framework consisting of an\nend-to-end trainable method and a planning algorithm. Particularly, we propose\na task-agnostic method named 'planning as in-painting'. In this method, we use\na Denoising Diffusion Model (DDM) for plan generation, conditioned on both\nlanguage instructions and perceptual inputs under partially observable\nenvironments. Partial observation often leads to the model hallucinating the\nplanning. Therefore, our diffusion-based method jointly models both state\ntrajectory and goal estimation to improve the reliability of the generated\nplan, given the limited available information at each step. To better leverage\nnewly discovered information along the plan execution for a higher success\nrate, we propose an on-the-fly planning algorithm to collaborate with the\ndiffusion-based planner. The proposed framework achieves promising performances\nin various embodied AI tasks, including vision-language navigation, object\nmanipulation, and task planning in a photorealistic virtual environment. The\ncode is available at: https://github.com/joeyy5588/planning-as-inpainting.\n\n---------------\n\n### 28 Apr 2021 | Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Selective Overview of Theories and Algorithms | ⬇️\nKaiqing Zhang, Zhuoran Yang, and Tamer Ba\c{s}ar \n\n Recent years have witnessed significant advances in reinforcement learning\n(RL), which has registered great success in solving various sequential\ndecision-making problems in machine learning. Most of the successful RL\napplications, e.g., the games of Go and Poker, robotics, and autonomous\ndriving, involve the participation of more than one single agent, which\nnaturally fall into the realm of multi-agent RL (MARL), a domain with a\nrelatively long history, and has recently re-emerged due to advances in\nsingle-agent RL techniques. Though empirically successful, theoretical\nfoundations for MARL are relatively lacking in the literature. In this chapter,\nwe provide a selective overview of MARL, with focus on algorithms backed by\ntheoretical analysis. More specifically, we review the theoretical results of\nMARL algorithms mainly within two representative frameworks, Markov/stochastic\ngames and extensive-form games, in accordance with the types of tasks they\naddress, i.e., fully cooperative, fully competitive, and a mix of the two. We\nalso introduce several significant but challenging applications of these\nalgorithms. Orthogonal to the existing reviews on MARL, we highlight several\nnew angles and taxonomies of MARL theory, including learning in extensive-form\ngames, decentralized MARL with networked agents, MARL in the mean-field regime,\n(non-)convergence of policy-based methods for learning in games, etc. Some of\nthe new angles extrapolate from our own research endeavors and interests. Our\noverall goal with this chapter is, beyond providing an assessment of the\ncurrent state of the field on the mark, to identify fruitful future research\ndirections on theoretical studies of MARL. We expect this chapter to serve as\ncontinuing stimulus for researchers interested in working on this exciting\nwhile challenging topic.\n\n---------------\n\n### 04 Mar 2020 | UNO: Uncertainty-aware Noisy-Or Multimodal Fusion for Unanticipated Input Degradation | ⬇️\nJunjiao Tian, Wesley Cheung, Nathan Glaser, Yen-Cheng Liu, Zsolt Kira \n\n The fusion of multiple sensor modalities, especially through deep learning\narchitectures, has been an active area of study. However, an under-explored\naspect of such work is whether the methods can be robust to degradations across\ntheir input modalities, especially when they must generalize to degradations\nnot seen during training. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware fusion\nscheme to effectively fuse inputs that might suffer from a range of known and\nunknown degradations. Specifically, we analyze a number of uncertainty\nmeasures, each of which captures a different aspect of uncertainty, and we\npropose a novel way to fuse degraded inputs by scaling modality-specific output\nsoftmax probabilities. We additionally propose a novel data-dependent spatial\ntemperature scaling method to complement these existing uncertainty measures.\nFinally, we integrate the uncertainty-scaled output from each modality using a\nprobabilistic noisy-or fusion method. In a photo-realistic simulation\nenvironment (AirSim), we show that our method achieves significantly better\nresults on a semantic segmentation task, compared to state-of-art fusion\narchitectures, on a range of degradations (e.g. fog, snow, frost, and various\nother types of noise), some of which are unknown during training. We\nspecifically improve upon the state-of-art[1] by 28% in mean IoU on various\ndegradations.

Most of these learning methods, though, rely on large training\nsets of images associated with human annotations that specifically describe the\nvisual content. In this paper we propose to go a step further and explore the\nmore complex cases where textual descriptions are loosely related to the\nimages. We focus on the particular domain of News articles in which the textual\ncontent often expresses connotative and ambiguous relations that are only\nsuggested but not directly inferred from images. We introduce new deep learning\nmethods that address source detection, popularity prediction, article\nillustration and geolocation of articles. An adaptive CNN architecture is\nproposed, that shares most of the structure for all the tasks, and is suitable\nfor multitask and transfer learning. Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis is\ndeployed for article illustration, and a new loss function based on Great\nCircle Distance is proposed for geolocation. Furthermore, we present\nBreakingNews, a novel dataset with approximately 100K news articles including\nimages, text and captions, and enriched with heterogeneous meta-data (such as\nGPS coordinates and popularity metrics). We show this dataset to be appropriate\nto explore all aforementioned problems, for which we provide a baseline\nperformance using various Deep Learning architectures, and different\nrepresentations of the textual and visual features. We report very promising\nresults and bring to light several limitations of current state-of-the-art in\nthis kind of domain, which we hope will help spur progress in the field.\n\n---------------\n\n### 31 May 2023 | Catalysis distillation neural network for the few shot open catalyst challenge | ⬇️\nBowen Deng \n\n The integration of artificial intelligence and science has resulted in\nsubstantial progress in computational chemistry methods for the design and\ndiscovery of novel catalysts. Nonetheless, the challenges of electrocatalytic\nreactions and developing a large-scale language model in catalysis persist, and\nthe recent success of ChatGPT's (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer)\nfew-shot methods surpassing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from\nTransformers) underscores the importance of addressing limited data, expensive\ncomputations, time constraints and structure-activity relationship in research.\nHence, the development of few-shot techniques for catalysis is critical and\nessential, regardless of present and future requirements. This paper introduces\nthe Few-Shot Open Catalyst Challenge 2023, a competition aimed at advancing the\napplication of machine learning technology for predicting catalytic reactions\non catalytic surfaces, with a specific focus on dual-atom catalysts in hydrogen\nperoxide electrocatalysis. To address the challenge of limited data in\ncatalysis, we propose a machine learning approach based on MLP-Like and a\nframework called Catalysis Distillation Graph Neural Network (CDGNN). Our\nresults demonstrate that CDGNN effectively learns embeddings from catalytic\nstructures, enabling the capture of structure-adsorption relationships. This\naccomplishment has resulted in the utmost advanced and efficient determination\nof the reaction pathway for hydrogen peroxide, surpassing the current graph\nneural network approach by 16.1%.. Consequently, CDGNN presents a promising\napproach for few-shot learning in catalysis.\n\n---------------\n\n### 03 Jul 2023 | Large Language and Text-to-3D Models for Engineering Design Optimization | ⬇️\nThiago Rios, Stefan Menzel, Bernhard Sendhoff (Honda Research Institute Europe) \n\n The current advances in generative AI for learning large neural network\nmodels with the capability to produce essays, images, music and even 3D assets\nfrom text prompts create opportunities for a manifold of disciplines. In the\npresent paper, we study the potential of deep text-to-3D models in the\nengineering domain, with focus on the chances and challenges when integrating\nand interacting with 3D assets in computational simulation-based design\noptimization. In contrast to traditional design optimization of 3D geometries\nthat often searches for the optimum designs using numerical representations,\nsuch as B-Spline surface or deformation parameters in vehicle aerodynamic\noptimization, natural language challenges the optimization framework by\nrequiring a different interpretation of variation operators while at the same\ntime may ease and motivate the human user interaction. Here, we propose and\nrealize a fully automated evolutionary design optimization framework using\nShap-E, a recently published text-to-3D asset network by OpenAI, in the context\nof aerodynamic vehicle optimization. For representing text prompts in the\nevolutionary optimization, we evaluate (a) a bag-of-words approach based on\nprompt templates and Wordnet samples, and (b) a tokenisation approach based on\nprompt templates and the byte pair encoding method from GPT4. Our main findings\nfrom the optimizations indicate that, first, it is important to ensure that the\ndesigns generated from prompts are within the object class of application, i.e.\ndiverse and novel designs need to be realistic, and, second, that more research\nis required to develop methods where the strength of text prompt variations and\nthe resulting variations of the 3D designs share causal relations to some\ndegree to improve the optimization.\n\n---------------\n\n### 07 Dec 2023 | Generative Judge for Evaluating Alignment | ⬇️\nJunlong Li, Shichao Sun, Weizhe Yuan, Run-Ze Fan, Hai Zhao, Pengfei Liu \n\n The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially\nexpanded the range of tasks they can address. In the field of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), researchers have shifted their focus from conventional NLP\ntasks (e.g., sequence tagging and parsing) towards tasks that revolve around\naligning with human needs (e.g., brainstorming and email writing). This shift\nin task distribution imposes new requirements on evaluating these aligned\nmodels regarding generality (i.e., assessing performance across diverse\nscenarios), flexibility (i.e., examining under different protocols), and\ninterpretability (i.e., scrutinizing models with explanations). In this paper,\nwe propose a generative judge with 13B parameters, Auto-J, designed to address\nthese challenges. Our model is trained on user queries and LLM-generated\nresponses under massive real-world scenarios and accommodates diverse\nevaluation protocols (e.g., pairwise response comparison and single-response\nevaluation) with well-structured natural language critiques. To demonstrate the\nefficacy of our approach, we construct a new testbed covering 58 different\nscenarios. Experimentally, Auto-J outperforms a series of strong competitors,\nincluding both open-source and closed-source models, by a large margin. We also\nprovide detailed analysis and case studies to further reveal the potential of\nour method and make a variety of resources public at\nhttps://github.com/GAIR-NLP/auto-j.\n\n---------------\n\n### 10 Dec 2018 | Auto-Meta: Automated Gradient Based Meta Learner Search | ⬇️\nJaehong Kim, Sangyeul Lee, Sungwan Kim, Moonsu Cha, Jung Kwon Lee, Youngduck Choi, Yongseok Choi, Dong-Yeon Cho, Jiwon Kim \n\n Fully automating machine learning pipelines is one of the key challenges of\ncurrent artificial intelligence research, since practical machine learning\noften requires costly and time-consuming human-powered processes such as model\ndesign, algorithm development, and hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we\nverify that automated architecture search synergizes with the effect of\ngradient-based meta learning. We adopt the progressive neural architecture\nsearch \cite{liu:pnas_google:DBLP

Large Language Models (LLM) are good at leveraging public data\non standard problems but once you want to tackle more specific complex\nquestions or problems (e.g. How does the concept of personal freedom vary\nbetween different cultures ? What is the best mix of power generation methods\nto reduce climate change ?) you may need specific architecture, knowledge,\nskills, methods, sensitive data protection, explainability, human approval and\nversatile feedback... Recent projects like ChatGPT and GALACTICA have allowed\nnon-specialists to grasp the great potential as well as the equally strong\nlimitations of LLM in complex QA. In this paper, we start by reviewing required\nskills and evaluation techniques. We integrate findings from the robust\ncommunity edited research papers BIG, BLOOM and HELM which open source,\nbenchmark and analyze limits and challenges of LLM in terms of tasks complexity\nand strict evaluation on accuracy (e.g. fairness, robustness, toxicity, ...) as\na baseline. We discuss some challenges associated with complex QA, including\ndomain adaptation, decomposition and efficient multi-step QA, long form and\nnon-factoid QA, safety and multi-sensitivity data protection, multimodal\nsearch, hallucinations, explainability and truthfulness, temporal reasoning. We\nanalyze current solutions and promising research trends, using elements such\nas: hybrid LLM architectural patterns, training and prompting strategies,\nactive human reinforcement learning supervised with AI, neuro-symbolic and\nstructured knowledge grounding, program synthesis, iterated decomposition and\nothers.\n4. <b> Entropy-Regularized Token-Level Policy Optimization for Large Language Models </b> \n Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as intelligent agents in\ninteractive decision-making tasks. Traditional approaches often depend on\nmeticulously designed prompts, high-quality examples, or additional reward\nmodels for in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, or RLHF. Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) presents a dynamic alternative for LLMs to overcome these\ndependencies by engaging directly with task-specific environments. Nonetheless,\nit faces significant hurdles: 1) instability stemming from the exponentially\nvast action space requiring exploration; 2) challenges in assigning token-level\ncredit based on action-level reward signals, resulting in discord between\nmaximizing rewards and accurately modeling corpus data. In response to these\nchallenges, we introduce Entropy-Regularized Token-level Policy Optimization\n(ETPO), an entropy-augmented RL method tailored for optimizing LLMs at the\ntoken level. At the heart of ETPO is our novel per-token soft Bellman update,\ndesigned to harmonize the RL process with the principles of language modeling.\nThis methodology decomposes the Q-function update from a coarse action-level\nview to a more granular token-level perspective, backed by theoretical proof of\noptimization consistency. Crucially, this decomposition renders linear time\ncomplexity in action exploration. We assess the effectiveness of ETPO within a\nsimulated environment that models data science code generation as a series of\nmulti-step interactive tasks; results show that ETPO achieves effective\nperformance improvement on the CodeLlama-7B model and surpasses a variant PPO\nbaseline inherited from RLHF. This underlines ETPO's potential as a robust\nmethod for refining the interactive decision-making capabilities of LLMs. Our\ncode is open-sourced at https://github.com/morning9393/ETPO.\n5. <b> ClausewitzGPT Framework: A New Frontier in Theoretical Large Language Model Enhanced Information Operations </b> \n Abstract: In a digital epoch where cyberspace is the emerging nexus of geopolitical\ncontention, the melding of information operations and Large Language Models\n(LLMs) heralds a paradigm shift, replete with immense opportunities and\nintricate challenges. As tools like the Mistral 7B LLM (Mistral, 2023)\ndemocratise access to LLM capabilities (Jin et al., 2023), a vast spectrum of\nactors, from sovereign nations to rogue entities (Howard et al., 2023), find\nthemselves equipped with potent narrative-shaping instruments (Goldstein et\nal., 2023). This paper puts forth a framework for navigating this brave new\nworld in the "ClausewitzGPT" equation. This novel formulation not only seeks to\nquantify the risks inherent in machine-speed LLM-augmented operations but also\nunderscores the vital role of autonomous AI agents (Wang, Xie, et al., 2023).\nThese agents, embodying ethical considerations (Hendrycks et al., 2021), emerge\nas indispensable components (Wang, Ma, et al., 2023), ensuring that as we race\nforward, we do not lose sight of moral compasses and societal imperatives.\n Mathematically underpinned and inspired by the timeless tenets of\nClausewitz's military strategy (Clausewitz, 1832), this thesis delves into the\nintricate dynamics of AI-augmented information operations. With references to\nrecent findings and research (Department of State, 2023), it highlights the\nstaggering year-on-year growth of AI information campaigns (Evgeny Pashentsev,\n2023), stressing the urgency of our current juncture. The synthesis of\nEnlightenment thinking, and Clausewitz's principles provides a foundational\nlens, emphasising the imperative of clear strategic vision, ethical\nconsiderations, and holistic understanding in the face of rapid technological\nadvancement.\n6. <b> Learning to Act with Affordance-Aware Multimodal Neural SLAM </b> \n Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an emerging paradigm shift toward embodied\nartificial intelligence, in which an agent must learn to solve challenging\ntasks by interacting with its environment. There are several challenges in\nsolving embodied multimodal tasks, including long-horizon planning,\nvision-and-language grounding, and efficient exploration. We focus on a\ncritical bottleneck, namely the performance of planning and navigation. To\ntackle this challenge, we propose a Neural SLAM approach that, for the first\ntime, utilizes several modalities for exploration, predicts an affordance-aware\nsemantic map, and plans over it at the same time. This significantly improves\nexploration efficiency, leads to robust long-horizon planning, and enables\neffective vision-and-language grounding. With the proposed Affordance-aware\nMultimodal Neural SLAM (AMSLAM) approach, we obtain more than 40% improvement\nover prior published work on the ALFRED benchmark and set a new\nstate-of-the-art generalization performance at a success rate of 23.48% on the\ntest unseen scenes.\n7. <b> Large-scale Multi-Modal Pre-trained Models: A Comprehensive Survey </b> \n Abstract: With the urgent demand for generalized deep models, many pre-trained big\nmodels are proposed, such as BERT, ViT, GPT, etc. Inspired by the success of\nthese models in single domains (like computer vision and natural language\nprocessing), the multi-modal pre-trained big models have also drawn more and\nmore attention in recent years. In this work, we give a comprehensive survey of\nthese models and hope this paper could provide new insights and helps fresh\nresearchers to track the most cutting-edge works. Specifically, we firstly\nintroduce the background of multi-modal pre-training by reviewing the\nconventional deep learning, pre-training works in natural language process,\ncomputer vision, and speech. Then, we introduce the task definition, key\nchallenges, and advantages of multi-modal pre-training models (MM-PTMs), and\ndiscuss the MM-PTMs with a focus on data, objectives, network architectures,\nand knowledge enhanced pre-training. After that, we introduce the downstream\ntasks used for the validation of large-scale MM-PTMs, including generative,\nclassification, and regression tasks. We also give visualization and analysis\nof the model parameters and results on representative downstream tasks.\nFinally, we point out possible research directions for this topic that may\nbenefit future works.

These tasks often involve complex multi-step reasoning, presenting\nsignificant challenges due to the limited paired data connecting human\ninstructions (e.g., making a smiley face) and robot actions (e.g., end-effector\nmovement). Existing approaches relieve this challenge by adopting an open-loop\nparadigm decomposing high-level instructions into simple sub-task plans, and\nexecuting them step-by-step using low-level control models. However, these\napproaches are short of instant observations in multi-step reasoning, leading\nto sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose to automatically\ncollect a cognitive robot dataset by Large Language Models (LLMs). The\nresulting dataset AlphaBlock consists of 35 comprehensive high-level tasks of\nmulti-step text plans and paired observation sequences. To enable efficient\ndata acquisition, we employ elaborated multi-round prompt designs that\neffectively reduce the burden of extensive human involvement. We further\npropose a closed-loop multi-modal embodied planning model that autoregressively\ngenerates plans by taking image observations as input. To facilitate effective\nlearning, we leverage MiniGPT-4 with a frozen visual encoder and LLM, and\nfinetune additional vision adapter and Q-former to enable fine-grained spatial\nperception for manipulation tasks. We conduct experiments to verify the\nsuperiority over existing open and closed-loop methods, and achieve a\nsignificant increase in success rate by 21.4% and 14.5% over ChatGPT and GPT-4\nbased robot tasks.

This issue of\nhallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these\npowerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives.\nThe journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily\nrelies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI\nsystems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of\nonline text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive\nlanguage fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information\nfrom the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or\nmodifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes\nhugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive\napplications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports,\netc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed\nto mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023),\nCoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we\nintroduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various\nparameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and\nretriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches\nspecifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we\nanalyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing\na solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related\nphenomena within the realm of LLMs.\n11. <b> Multimodality Representation Learning: A Survey on Evolution, Pretraining and Its Applications </b> \n Abstract: Multimodality Representation Learning, as a technique of learning to embed\ninformation from different modalities and their correlations, has achieved\nremarkable success on a variety of applications, such as Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA), Natural Language for Visual Reasoning (NLVR), and Vision\nLanguage Retrieval (VLR). Among these applications, cross-modal interaction and\ncomplementary information from different modalities are crucial for advanced\nmodels to perform any multimodal task, e.g., understand, recognize, retrieve,\nor generate optimally. Researchers have proposed diverse methods to address\nthese tasks. The different variants of transformer-based architectures\nperformed extraordinarily on multiple modalities. This survey presents the\ncomprehensive literature on the evolution and enhancement of deep learning\nmultimodal architectures to deal with textual, visual and audio features for\ndiverse cross-modal and modern multimodal tasks. This study summarizes the (i)\nrecent task-specific deep learning methodologies, (ii) the pretraining types\nand multimodal pretraining objectives, (iii) from state-of-the-art pretrained\nmultimodal approaches to unifying architectures, and (iv) multimodal task\ncategories and possible future improvements that can be devised for better\nmultimodal learning. Moreover, we prepare a dataset section for new researchers\nthat covers most of the benchmarks for pretraining and finetuning. Finally,\nmajor challenges, gaps, and potential research topics are explored. A\nconstantly-updated paperlist related to our survey is maintained at\nhttps://github.com/marslanm/multimodality-representation-learning.\n12. <b> ProcTHOR: Large-Scale Embodied AI Using Procedural Generation </b> \n Abstract: Massive datasets and high-capacity models have driven many recent\nadvancements in computer vision and natural language understanding. This work\npresents a platform to enable similar success stories in Embodied AI. We\npropose ProcTHOR, a framework for procedural generation of Embodied AI\nenvironments. ProcTHOR enables us to sample arbitrarily large datasets of\ndiverse, interactive, customizable, and performant virtual environments to\ntrain and evaluate embodied agents across navigation, interaction, and\nmanipulation tasks. We demonstrate the power and potential of ProcTHOR via a\nsample of 10,000 generated houses and a simple neural model. Models trained\nusing only RGB images on ProcTHOR, with no explicit mapping and no human task\nsupervision produce state-of-the-art results across 6 embodied AI benchmarks\nfor navigation, rearrangement, and arm manipulation, including the presently\nrunning Habitat 2022, AI2-THOR Rearrangement 2022, and RoboTHOR challenges. We\nalso demonstrate strong 0-shot results on these benchmarks, via pre-training on\nProcTHOR with no fine-tuning on the downstream benchmark, often beating\nprevious state-of-the-art systems that access the downstream training data.\n13. <b> Planning as In-Painting: A Diffusion-Based Embodied Task Planning Framework for Environments under Uncertainty </b> \n Abstract: Task planning for embodied AI has been one of the most challenging problems\nwhere the community does not meet a consensus in terms of formulation. In this\npaper, we aim to tackle this problem with a unified framework consisting of an\nend-to-end trainable method and a planning algorithm. Particularly, we propose\na task-agnostic method named 'planning as in-painting'. In this method, we use\na Denoising Diffusion Model (DDM) for plan generation, conditioned on both\nlanguage instructions and perceptual inputs under partially observable\nenvironments. Partial observation often leads to the model hallucinating the\nplanning. Therefore, our diffusion-based method jointly models both state\ntrajectory and goal estimation to improve the reliability of the generated\nplan, given the limited available information at each step. To better leverage\nnewly discovered information along the plan execution for a higher success\nrate, we propose an on-the-fly planning algorithm to collaborate with the\ndiffusion-based planner. The proposed framework achieves promising performances\nin various embodied AI tasks, including vision-language navigation, object\nmanipulation, and task planning in a photorealistic virtual environment. The\ncode is available at: https://github.com/joeyy5588/planning-as-inpainting.\n14. <b> Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Selective Overview of Theories and Algorithms </b> \n Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant advances in reinforcement learning\n(RL), which has registered great success in solving various sequential\ndecision-making problems in machine learning. Most of the successful RL\napplications, e.g., the games of Go and Poker, robotics, and autonomous\ndriving, involve the participation of more than one single agent, which\nnaturally fall into the realm of multi-agent RL (MARL), a domain with a\nrelatively long history, and has recently re-emerged due to advances in\nsingle-agent RL techniques. Though empirically successful, theoretical\nfoundations for MARL are relatively lacking in the literature. In this chapter,\nwe provide a selective overview of MARL, with focus on algorithms backed by\ntheoretical analysis. More specifically, we review the theoretical results of\nMARL algorithms mainly within two representative frameworks, Markov/stochastic\ngames and extensive-form games, in accordance with the types of tasks they\naddress, i.e., fully cooperative, fully competitive, and a mix of the two. We\nalso introduce several significant but challenging applications of these\nalgorithms. Orthogonal to the existing reviews on MARL, we highlight several\nnew angles and taxonomies of MARL theory, including learning in extensive-form\ngames, decentralized MARL with networked agents, MARL in the mean-field regime,\n(non-)convergence of policy-based methods for learning in games, etc. Some of\nthe new angles extrapolate from our own research endeavors and interests. Our\noverall goal with this chapter is, beyond providing an assessment of the\ncurrent state of the field on the mark, to identify fruitful future research\ndirections on theoretical studies of MARL. We expect this chapter to serve as\ncontinuing stimulus for researchers interested in working on this exciting\nwhile challenging topic.\n15. <b> UNO: Uncertainty-aware Noisy-Or Multimodal Fusion for Unanticipated Input Degradation </b> \n Abstract: The fusion of multiple sensor modalities, especially through deep learning\narchitectures, has been an active area of study. However, an under-explored\naspect of such work is whether the methods can be robust to degradations across\ntheir input modalities, especially when they must generalize to degradations\nnot seen during training. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware fusion\nscheme to effectively fuse inputs that might suffer from a range of known and\nunknown degradations. Specifically, we analyze a number of uncertainty\nmeasures, each of which captures a different aspect of uncertainty, and we\npropose a novel way to fuse degraded inputs by scaling modality-specific output\nsoftmax probabilities. We additionally propose a novel data-dependent spatial\ntemperature scaling method to complement these existing uncertainty measures.\nFinally, we integrate the uncertainty-scaled output from each modality using a\nprobabilistic noisy-or fusion method. In a photo-realistic simulation\nenvironment (AirSim), we show that our method achieves significantly better\nresults on a semantic segmentation task, compared to state-of-art fusion\narchitectures, on a range of degradations (e.g. fog, snow, frost, and various\nother types of noise), some of which are unknown during training. We\nspecifically improve upon the state-of-art[1] by 28% in mean IoU on various\ndegradations.

Most of these learning methods, though, rely on large training\nsets of images associated with human annotations that specifically describe the\nvisual content. In this paper we propose to go a step further and explore the\nmore complex cases where textual descriptions are loosely related to the\nimages. We focus on the particular domain of News articles in which the textual\ncontent often expresses connotative and ambiguous relations that are only\nsuggested but not directly inferred from images. We introduce new deep learning\nmethods that address source detection, popularity prediction, article\nillustration and geolocation of articles. An adaptive CNN architecture is\nproposed, that shares most of the structure for all the tasks, and is suitable\nfor multitask and transfer learning. Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis is\ndeployed for article illustration, and a new loss function based on Great\nCircle Distance is proposed for geolocation. Furthermore, we present\nBreakingNews, a novel dataset with approximately 100K news articles including\nimages, text and captions, and enriched with heterogeneous meta-data (such as\nGPS coordinates and popularity metrics). We show this dataset to be appropriate\nto explore all aforementioned problems, for which we provide a baseline\nperformance using various Deep Learning architectures, and different\nrepresentations of the textual and visual features. We report very promising\nresults and bring to light several limitations of current state-of-the-art in\nthis kind of domain, which we hope will help spur progress in the field.\n17. <b> Catalysis distillation neural network for the few shot open catalyst challenge </b> \n Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence and science has resulted in\nsubstantial progress in computational chemistry methods for the design and\ndiscovery of novel catalysts. Nonetheless, the challenges of electrocatalytic\nreactions and developing a large-scale language model in catalysis persist, and\nthe recent success of ChatGPT's (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer)\nfew-shot methods surpassing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from\nTransformers) underscores the importance of addressing limited data, expensive\ncomputations, time constraints and structure-activity relationship in research.\nHence, the development of few-shot techniques for catalysis is critical and\nessential, regardless of present and future requirements. This paper introduces\nthe Few-Shot Open Catalyst Challenge 2023, a competition aimed at advancing the\napplication of machine learning technology for predicting catalytic reactions\non catalytic surfaces, with a specific focus on dual-atom catalysts in hydrogen\nperoxide electrocatalysis. To address the challenge of limited data in\ncatalysis, we propose a machine learning approach based on MLP-Like and a\nframework called Catalysis Distillation Graph Neural Network (CDGNN). Our\nresults demonstrate that CDGNN effectively learns embeddings from catalytic\nstructures, enabling the capture of structure-adsorption relationships. This\naccomplishment has resulted in the utmost advanced and efficient determination\nof the reaction pathway for hydrogen peroxide, surpassing the current graph\nneural network approach by 16.1%.. Consequently, CDGNN presents a promising\napproach for few-shot learning in catalysis.\n18. <b> Large Language and Text-to-3D Models for Engineering Design Optimization </b> \n Abstract: The current advances in generative AI for learning large neural network\nmodels with the capability to produce essays, images, music and even 3D assets\nfrom text prompts create opportunities for a manifold of disciplines. In the\npresent paper, we study the potential of deep text-to-3D models in the\nengineering domain, with focus on the chances and challenges when integrating\nand interacting with 3D assets in computational simulation-based design\noptimization. In contrast to traditional design optimization of 3D geometries\nthat often searches for the optimum designs using numerical representations,\nsuch as B-Spline surface or deformation parameters in vehicle aerodynamic\noptimization, natural language challenges the optimization framework by\nrequiring a different interpretation of variation operators while at the same\ntime may ease and motivate the human user interaction. Here, we propose and\nrealize a fully automated evolutionary design optimization framework using\nShap-E, a recently published text-to-3D asset network by OpenAI, in the context\nof aerodynamic vehicle optimization. For representing text prompts in the\nevolutionary optimization, we evaluate (a) a bag-of-words approach based on\nprompt templates and Wordnet samples, and (b) a tokenisation approach based on\nprompt templates and the byte pair encoding method from GPT4. Our main findings\nfrom the optimizations indicate that, first, it is important to ensure that the\ndesigns generated from prompts are within the object class of application, i.e.\ndiverse and novel designs need to be realistic, and, second, that more research\nis required to develop methods where the strength of text prompt variations and\nthe resulting variations of the 3D designs share causal relations to some\ndegree to improve the optimization.\n19. <b> Generative Judge for Evaluating Alignment </b> \n Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially\nexpanded the range of tasks they can address. In the field of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), researchers have shifted their focus from conventional NLP\ntasks (e.g., sequence tagging and parsing) towards tasks that revolve around\naligning with human needs (e.g., brainstorming and email writing). This shift\nin task distribution imposes new requirements on evaluating these aligned\nmodels regarding generality (i.e., assessing performance across diverse\nscenarios), flexibility (i.e., examining under different protocols), and\ninterpretability (i.e., scrutinizing models with explanations). In this paper,\nwe propose a generative judge with 13B parameters, Auto-J, designed to address\nthese challenges. Our model is trained on user queries and LLM-generated\nresponses under massive real-world scenarios and accommodates diverse\nevaluation protocols (e.g., pairwise response comparison and single-response\nevaluation) with well-structured natural language critiques. To demonstrate the\nefficacy of our approach, we construct a new testbed covering 58 different\nscenarios. Experimentally, Auto-J outperforms a series of strong competitors,\nincluding both open-source and closed-source models, by a large margin. We also\nprovide detailed analysis and case studies to further reveal the potential of\nour method and make a variety of resources public at\nhttps://github.com/GAIR-NLP/auto-j.\n20. <b> Auto-Meta: Automated Gradient Based Meta Learner Search </b> \n Abstract: Fully automating machine learning pipelines is one of the key challenges of\ncurrent artificial intelligence research, since practical machine learning\noften requires costly and time-consuming human-powered processes such as model\ndesign, algorithm development, and hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we\nverify that automated architecture search synergizes with the effect of\ngradient-based meta learning. We adopt the progressive neural architecture\nsearch \cite{liu:pnas_google:DBLP

Question: ('# 🩺🔍 Search Results ### 24 May 2022 | Core Challenges in Embodied Vision-Language Planning | ⬇️ Jonathan Francis, Nariaki Kitamura, Felix Labelle, Xiaopeng Lu, Ingrid Navarro, Jean Oh Recent advances in the areas of multimodal machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI. Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered, more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning (EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments, as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers real-world deployment. --------------- ### 03 Mar 2020 | Adaptive Prior Selection for Repertoire-based Online Adaptation in Robotics | ⬇️ Rituraj Kaushik, Pierre Desreumaux, Jean-Baptiste Mouret Repertoire-based learning is a data-efficient adaptation approach based on a two-step process in which (1) a large and diverse set of policies is learned in simulation, and (2) a planning or learning algorithm chooses the most appropriate policies according to the current situation (e.g., a damaged robot, a new object, etc.). In this paper, we relax the assumption of previous works that a single repertoire is enough for adaptation. Instead, we generate repertoires for many different situations (e.g., with a missing leg, on different floors, etc.) and let our algorithm selects the most useful prior. Our main contribution is an algorithm, APROL (Adaptive Prior selection for Repertoire-based Online Learning) to plan the next action by incorporating these priors when the robot has no information about the current situation. We evaluate APROL on two simulated tasks: (1) pushing unknown objects of various shapes and sizes with a robotic arm and (2) a goal reaching task with a damaged hexapod robot. We compare with "Reset-free Trial and Error" (RTE) and various single repertoire-based baselines. The results show that APROL solves both the tasks in less interaction time than the baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate APROL on a real, damaged hexapod that quickly learns to pick compensatory policies to reach a goal by avoiding obstacles in the path. --------------- ### 10 Nov 2023 | A Survey of AI Text-to-Image and AI Text-to-Video Generators | ⬇️ Aditi Singh Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generation models are revolutionary technologies that use deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create images and videos from textual descriptions. This paper investigates cutting-edge approaches in the discipline of Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generations. The survey provides an overview of the existing literature as well as an analysis of the approaches used in various studies. It covers data preprocessing techniques, neural network types, and evaluation metrics used in the field. In addition, the paper discusses the challenges and limitations of Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generations, as well as future research directions. Overall, these models have promising potential for a wide range of applications such as video production, content creation, and digital marketing. --------------- ### 17 Apr 2023 | Affordances from Human Videos as a Versatile Representation for Robotics | ⬇️ Shikhar Bahl, Russell Mendonca, Lili Chen, Unnat Jain, Deepak Pathak Building a robot that can understand and learn to interact by watching humans has inspired several vision problems. However, despite some successful results on static datasets, it remains unclear how current models can be used on a robot directly. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging videos of human interactions in an environment centric manner. Utilizing internet videos of human behavior, we train a visual affordance model that estimates where and how in the scene a human is likely to interact. The structure of these behavioral affordances directly enables the robot to perform many complex tasks. We show how to seamlessly integrate our affordance model with four robot learning paradigms including offline imitation learning, exploration, goal-conditioned learning, and action parameterization for reinforcement learning. We show the efficacy of our approach, which we call VRB, across 4 real world environments, over 10 different tasks, and 2 robotic platforms operating in the wild.

The creative sectors have always been early adopters of AI technologies and this continues to be the case. As a matter of fact, recent technological developments keep pushing the boundaries of intelligent systems in creative applications: the critically acclaimed movie "Sunspring", released in 2016, was entirely written by AI technology, and the first-ever Music Album, called "Hello World", produced using AI has been released this year. Simultaneously, the exploratory nature of the creative process is raising important technical challenges for AI such as the ability for AI-powered techniques to be accurate under limited data resources, as opposed to the conventional "Big Data" approach, or the ability to process, analyse and match data from multiple modalities (text, sound, images, etc.) at the same time. The purpose of this white paper is to understand future technological advances in AI and their growing impact on creative industries. This paper addresses the following questions: Where does AI operate in creative Industries? What is its operative role? How will AI transform creative industries in the next ten years? This white paper aims to provide a realistic perspective of the scope of AI actions in creative industries, proposes a vision of how this technology could contribute to research and development works in such context, and identifies research and development challenges. --------------- ### 01 Feb 2024 | Where are we in the search for an Artificial Visual Cortex for Embodied Intelligence? | ⬇️ Arjun Majumdar, Karmesh Yadav, Sergio Arnaud, Yecheng Jason Ma, Claire Chen, Sneha Silwal, Aryan Jain, Vincent-Pierre Berges, Pieter Abbeel, Jitendra Malik, Dhruv Batra, Yixin Lin, Oleksandr Maksymets, Aravind Rajeswaran, Franziska Meier We present the largest and most comprehensive empirical study of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) or visual \'foundation models\' for Embodied AI. First, we curate CortexBench, consisting of 17 different tasks spanning locomotion, navigation, dexterous, and mobile manipulation. Next, we systematically evaluate existing PVRs and find that none are universally dominant. To study the effect of pre-training data size and diversity, we combine over 4,000 hours of egocentric videos from 7 different sources (over 4.3M images) and ImageNet to train different-sized vision transformers using Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) on slices of this data. Contrary to inferences from prior work, we find that scaling dataset size and diversity does not improve performance universally (but does so on average). Our largest model, named VC-1, outperforms all prior PVRs on average but does not universally dominate either. Next, we show that task- or domain-specific adaptation of VC-1 leads to substantial gains, with VC-1 (adapted) achieving competitive or superior performance than the best known results on all of the benchmarks in CortexBench. Finally, we present real-world hardware experiments, in which VC-1 and VC-1 (adapted) outperform the strongest pre-existing PVR. Overall, this paper presents no new techniques but a rigorous systematic evaluation, a broad set of findings about PVRs (that in some cases, refute those made in narrow domains in prior work), and open-sourced code and models (that required over 10,000 GPU-hours to train) for the benefit of the research community. --------------- ### 18 Oct 2023 | From Neural Activations to Concepts: A Survey on Explaining Concepts in Neural Networks | ⬇️ Jae Hee Lee, Sergio Lanza, Stefan Wermter In this paper, we review recent approaches for explaining concepts in neural networks. Concepts can act as a natural link between learning and reasoning: once the concepts are identified that a neural learning system uses, one can integrate those concepts with a reasoning system for inference or use a reasoning system to act upon them to improve or enhance the learning system. On the other hand, knowledge can not only be extracted from neural networks but concept knowledge can also be inserted into neural network architectures. Since integrating learning and reasoning is at the core of neuro-symbolic AI, the insights gained from this survey can serve as an important step towards realizing neuro-symbolic AI based on explainable concepts. --------------- ### 09 Oct 2019 | Imagined Value Gradients: Model-Based Policy Optimization with Transferable Latent Dynamics Models | ⬇️ Arunkumar Byravan, Jost Tobias Springenberg, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Roland Hafner, Michael Neunert, Thomas Lampe, Noah Siegel, Nicolas Heess, Martin Riedmiller Humans are masters at quickly learning many complex tasks, relying on an approximate understanding of the dynamics of their environments. In much the same way, we would like our learning agents to quickly adapt to new tasks. In this paper, we explore how model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) can facilitate transfer to new tasks. We develop an algorithm that learns an action-conditional, predictive model of expected future observations, rewards and values from which a policy can be derived by following the gradient of the estimated value along imagined trajectories. We show how robust policy optimization can be achieved in robot manipulation tasks even with approximate models that are learned directly from vision and proprioception. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in a transfer learning scenario, re-using previously learned models on tasks with different reward structures and visual distractors, and show a significant improvement in learning speed compared to strong off-policy baselines. Videos with results can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/ivg-corl19 --------------- ### 08 Mar 2016 | Deep Tracking: Seeing Beyond Seeing Using Recurrent Neural Networks | ⬇️ Peter Ondruska, Ingmar Posner This paper presents to the best of our knowledge the first end-to-end object tracking approach which directly maps from raw sensor input to object tracks in sensor space without requiring any feature engineering or system identification in the form of plant or sensor models. Specifically, our system accepts a stream of raw sensor data at one end and, in real-time, produces an estimate of the entire environment state at the output including even occluded objects. We achieve this by framing the problem as a deep learning task and exploit sequence models in the form of recurrent neural networks to learn a mapping from sensor measurements to object tracks. In particular, we propose a learning method based on a form of input dropout which allows learning in an unsupervised manner, only based on raw, occluded sensor data without access to ground-truth annotations. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the task of tracking objects in 2D laser data -- as commonly encountered in robotics applications -- and show that it learns to track many dynamic objects despite occlusions and the presence of sensor noise. --------------- ### 26 Sep 2023 | Creating Trustworthy LLMs: Dealing with Hallucinations in Healthcare AI | ⬇️ Muhammad Aurangzeb Ahmad, Ilker Yaramis, Taposh Dutta Roy Large language models have proliferated across multiple domains in as short period of time. There is however hesitation in the medical and healthcare domain towards their adoption because of issues like factuality, coherence, and hallucinations. Give the high stakes nature of healthcare, many researchers have even cautioned against its usage until these issues are resolved. The key to the implementation and deployment of LLMs in healthcare is to make these models trustworthy, transparent (as much possible) and explainable. In this paper we describe the key elements in creating reliable, trustworthy, and unbiased models as a necessary condition for their adoption in healthcare. Specifically we focus on the quantification, validation, and mitigation of hallucinations in the context in healthcare. Lastly, we discuss how the future of LLMs in healthcare may look like. --------------- ### 24 May 2023 | Prompt Evolution for Generative AI: A Classifier-Guided Approach | ⬇️ Melvin Wong, Yew-Soon Ong, Abhishek Gupta, Kavitesh K. Bali, Caishun Chen Synthesis of digital artifacts conditioned on user prompts has become an important paradigm facilitating an explosion of use cases with generative AI. However, such models often fail to connect the generated outputs and desired target concepts/preferences implied by the prompts. Current research addressing this limitation has largely focused on enhancing the prompts before output generation or improving the model\'s performance up front. In contrast, this paper conceptualizes prompt evolution, imparting evolutionary selection pressure and variation during the generative process to produce multiple outputs that satisfy the target concepts/preferences better. We propose a multi-objective instantiation of this broader idea that uses a multi-label image classifier-guided approach. The predicted labels from the classifiers serve as multiple objectives to optimize, with the aim of producing diversified images that meet user preferences. A novelty of our evolutionary algorithm is that the pre-trained generative model gives us implicit mutation operations, leveraging the model\'s stochastic generative capability to automate the creation of Pareto-optimized images more faithful to user preferences. --------------- ### 22 Jul 2020 | Analogical Reasoning for Visually Grounded Language Acquisition | ⬇️ Bo Wu, Haoyu Qin, Alireza Zareian, Carl Vondrick, Shih-Fu Chang Children acquire language subconsciously by observing the surrounding world and listening to descriptions. They can discover the meaning of words even without explicit language knowledge, and generalize to novel compositions effortlessly. In this paper, we bring this ability to AI, by studying the task of Visually grounded Language Acquisition (VLA). We propose a multimodal transformer model augmented with a novel mechanism for analogical reasoning, which approximates novel compositions by learning semantic mapping and reasoning operations from previously seen compositions. Our proposed method, Analogical Reasoning Transformer Networks (ARTNet), is trained on raw multimedia data (video frames and transcripts), and after observing a set of compositions such as "washing apple" or "cutting carrot", it can generalize and recognize new compositions in new video frames, such as "washing carrot" or "cutting apple". To this end, ARTNet refers to relevant instances in the training data and uses their visual features and captions to establish analogies with the query image. Then it chooses the suitable verb and noun to create a new composition that describes the new image best. Extensive experiments on an instructional video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly better generalization capability and recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. --------------- ### 03 Nov 2023 | Nahid: AI-based Algorithm for operating fully-automatic surgery | ⬇️ Sina Saadati In this paper, for the first time, a method is presented that can provide a fully automated surgery based on software and computer vision techniques.

However, fake facial expressions are difficult to be recognized even by humans. On the other hand, facial micro-expressions generally represent the actual emotion of a person, as it is a spontaneous reaction expressed through human face. Despite of a few attempts made for recognizing micro-expressions, still the problem is far from being a solved problem, which is depicted by the poor rate of accuracy shown by the state-of-the-art methods. A few CNN based approaches are found in the literature to recognize micro-facial expressions from still images. Whereas, a spontaneous micro-expression video contains multiple frames that have to be processed together to encode both spatial and temporal information. This paper proposes two 3D-CNN methods: MicroExpSTCNN and MicroExpFuseNet, for spontaneous facial micro-expression recognition by exploiting the spatiotemporal information in CNN framework. The MicroExpSTCNN considers the full spatial information, whereas the MicroExpFuseNet is based on the 3D-CNN feature fusion of the eyes and mouth regions. The experiments are performed over CAS(ME)^2 and SMIC micro-expression databases. The proposed MicroExpSTCNN model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. --------------- ### 24 Nov 2017 | Interactive Robot Learning of Gestures, Language and Affordances | ⬇️ Giovanni Saponaro, Lorenzo Jamone, Alexandre Bernardino, Giampiero Salvi A growing field in robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is human-robot collaboration, whose target is to enable effective teamwork between humans and robots. However, in many situations human teams are still superior to human-robot teams, primarily because human teams can easily agree on a common goal with language, and the individual members observe each other effectively, leveraging their shared motor repertoire and sensorimotor resources. This paper shows that for cognitive robots it is possible, and indeed fruitful, to combine knowledge acquired from interacting with elements of the environment (affordance exploration) with the probabilistic observation of another agent\'s actions. We propose a model that unites (i) learning robot affordances and word descriptions with (ii) statistical recognition of human gestures with vision sensors. We discuss theoretical motivations, possible implementations, and we show initial results which highlight that, after having acquired knowledge of its surrounding environment, a humanoid robot can generalize this knowledge to the case when it observes another agent (human partner) performing the same motor actions previously executed during training. --------------- ### 12 Mar 2024 | NavCoT: Boosting LLM-Based Vision-and-Language Navigation via Learning Disentangled Reasoning | ⬇️ Bingqian Lin, Yunshuang Nie, Ziming Wei, Jiaqi Chen, Shikui Ma, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Xiaojun Chang, Xiaodan Liang Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/NavCoT. --------------- ### 19 Jan 2024 | Understanding Video Transformers via Universal Concept Discovery | ⬇️ Matthew Kowal, Achal Dave, Rares Ambrus, Adrien Gaidon, Konstantinos G. Derpanis, Pavel Tokmakov This paper studies the problem of concept-based interpretability of transformer representations for videos. Concretely, we seek to explain the decision-making process of video transformers based on high-level, spatiotemporal concepts that are automatically discovered. Prior research on concept-based interpretability has concentrated solely on image-level tasks. Comparatively, video models deal with the added temporal dimension, increasing complexity and posing challenges in identifying dynamic concepts over time. In this work, we systematically address these challenges by introducing the first Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm. To this end, we propose an efficient approach for unsupervised identification of units of video transformer representations - concepts, and ranking their importance to the output of a model. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable, revealing spatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstructured video models. Performing this analysis jointly over a diverse set of supervised and self-supervised representations, we discover that some of these mechanism are universal in video transformers. Finally, we demonstrate that VTCDcan be used to improve model performance for fine-grained tasks. --------------- ### 02 May 2022 | ComPhy: Compositional Physical Reasoning of Objects and Events from Videos | ⬇️ Zhenfang Chen, Kexin Yi, Yunzhu Li, Mingyu Ding, Antonio Torralba, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Chuang Gan Objects\' motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their properties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be identified via the object\'s visual appearances, others like mass and electric charge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and hidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the physical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited observations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually observable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact interaction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance of inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual appearances, by introducing the Compositional Physical Reasoning (ComPhy) dataset. For a given set of objects, ComPhy includes few videos of them moving and interacting under different initial conditions. The model is evaluated based on its capability to unravel the compositional hidden properties, such as mass and charge, and use this knowledge to answer a set of questions posted on one of the videos. Evaluation results of several state-of-the-art video reasoning models on ComPhy show unsatisfactory performance as they fail to capture these hidden properties. We further propose an oracle neural-symbolic framework named Compositional Physics Learner (CPL), combining visual perception, physical property learning, dynamic prediction, and symbolic execution into a unified framework. CPL can effectively identify objects\' physical properties from their interactions and predict their dynamics to answer questions. --------------- ### 01 Aug 2022 | PACS: A Dataset for Physical Audiovisual CommonSense Reasoning | ⬇️ Samuel Yu, Peter Wu, Paul Pu Liang, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Louis-Philippe Morency In order for AI to be safely deployed in real-world scenarios such as hospitals, schools, and the workplace, it must be able to robustly reason about the physical world. Fundamental to this reasoning is physical common sense: understanding the physical properties and affordances of available objects, how they can be manipulated, and how they interact with other objects. Physical commonsense reasoning is fundamentally a multi-sensory task, since physical properties are manifested through multiple modalities - two of them being vision and acoustics. Our paper takes a step towards real-world physical commonsense reasoning by contributing PACS: the first audiovisual benchmark annotated for physical commonsense attributes. PACS contains 13,400 question-answer pairs, involving 1,377 unique physical commonsense questions and 1,526 videos. Our dataset provides new opportunities to advance the research field of physical reasoning by bringing audio as a core component of this multimodal problem. Using PACS, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models on our new challenging task. While some models show promising results (70% accuracy), they all fall short of human performance (95% accuracy). We conclude the paper by demonstrating the importance of multimodal reasoning and providing possible avenues for future research. --------------- ### 19 Jun 2019 | PyRobot: An Open-source Robotics Framework for Research and Benchmarking | ⬇️ Adithyavairavan Murali, Tao Chen, Kalyan Vasudev Alwala, Dhiraj Gandhi, Lerrel Pinto, Saurabh Gupta, Abhinav Gupta This paper introduces PyRobot, an open-source robotics framework for research and benchmarking. PyRobot is a light-weight, high-level interface on top of ROS that provides a consistent set of hardware independent mid-level APIs to control different robots. PyRobot abstracts away details about low-level controllers and inter-process communication, and allows non-robotics researchers (ML, CV researchers) to focus on building high-level AI applications. PyRobot aims to provide a research ecosystem with convenient access to robotics datasets, algorithm implementations and models that can be used to quickly create a state-of-the-art baseline. We believe PyRobot, when paired up with low-cost robot platforms such as LoCoBot, will reduce the entry barrier into robotics, and democratize robotics. PyRobot is open-source, and can be accessed via https://pyrobot.org. ---------------', '<s>[INST] Context: 1. <b> Core Challenges in Embodied Vision-Language Planning </b> Abstract: Recent advances in the areas of multimodal machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI. Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered, more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning (EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments, as well as the datasets used for EVLP tasks. Finally, we present the core challenges that we believe new EVLP works should seek to address, and we advocate for task construction that enables model generalizability and furthers real-world deployment. 2. <b> Adaptive Prior Selection for Repertoire-based Online Adaptation in Robotics </b> Abstract: Repertoire-based learning is a data-efficient adaptation approach based on a two-step process in which (1) a large and diverse set of policies is learned in simulation, and (2) a planning or learning algorithm chooses the most appropriate policies according to the current situation (e.g., a damaged robot, a new object, etc.). In this paper, we relax the assumption of previous works that a single repertoire is enough for adaptation. Instead, we generate repertoires for many different situations (e.g., with a missing leg, on different floors, etc.) and let our algorithm selects the most useful prior. Our main contribution is an algorithm, APROL (Adaptive Prior selection for Repertoire-based Online Learning) to plan the next action by incorporating these priors when the robot has no information about the current situation. We evaluate APROL on two simulated tasks: (1) pushing unknown objects of various shapes and sizes with a robotic arm and (2) a goal reaching task with a damaged hexapod robot. We compare with "Reset-free Trial and Error" (RTE) and various single repertoire-based baselines. The results show that APROL solves both the tasks in less interaction time than the baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate APROL on a real, damaged hexapod that quickly learns to pick compensatory policies to reach a goal by avoiding obstacles in the path. 3. <b> A Survey of AI Text-to-Image and AI Text-to-Video Generators </b> Abstract: Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generation models are revolutionary technologies that use deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create images and videos from textual descriptions. This paper investigates cutting-edge approaches in the discipline of Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generations. The survey provides an overview of the existing literature as well as an analysis of the approaches used in various studies. It covers data preprocessing techniques, neural network types, and evaluation metrics used in the field. In addition, the paper discusses the challenges and limitations of Text-to-Image and Text-to-Video AI generations, as well as future research directions. Overall, these models have promising potential for a wide range of applications such as video production, content creation, and digital marketing. 4. <b> Affordances from Human Videos as a Versatile Representation for Robotics </b> Abstract: Building a robot that can understand and learn to interact by watching humans has inspired several vision problems. However, despite some successful results on static datasets, it remains unclear how current models can be used on a robot directly. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by leveraging videos of human interactions in an environment centric manner. Utilizing internet videos of human behavior, we train a visual affordance model that estimates where and how in the scene a human is likely to interact. The structure of these behavioral affordances directly enables the robot to perform many complex tasks. We show how to seamlessly integrate our affordance model with four robot learning paradigms including offline imitation learning, exploration, goal-conditioned learning, and action parameterization for reinforcement learning. We show the efficacy of our approach, which we call VRB, across 4 real world environments, over 10 different tasks, and 2 robotic platforms operating in the wild.

The creative sectors have always been early adopters of AI technologies and this continues to be the case. As a matter of fact, recent technological developments keep pushing the boundaries of intelligent systems in creative applications: the critically acclaimed movie "Sunspring", released in 2016, was entirely written by AI technology, and the first-ever Music Album, called "Hello World", produced using AI has been released this year. Simultaneously, the exploratory nature of the creative process is raising important technical challenges for AI such as the ability for AI-powered techniques to be accurate under limited data resources, as opposed to the conventional "Big Data" approach, or the ability to process, analyse and match data from multiple modalities (text, sound, images, etc.) at the same time. The purpose of this white paper is to understand future technological advances in AI and their growing impact on creative industries. This paper addresses the following questions: Where does AI operate in creative Industries? What is its operative role? How will AI transform creative industries in the next ten years? This white paper aims to provide a realistic perspective of the scope of AI actions in creative industries, proposes a vision of how this technology could contribute to research and development works in such context, and identifies research and development challenges. 6. <b> Where are we in the search for an Artificial Visual Cortex for Embodied Intelligence? </b> Abstract: We present the largest and most comprehensive empirical study of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) or visual \'foundation models\' for Embodied AI. First, we curate CortexBench, consisting of 17 different tasks spanning locomotion, navigation, dexterous, and mobile manipulation. Next, we systematically evaluate existing PVRs and find that none are universally dominant. To study the effect of pre-training data size and diversity, we combine over 4,000 hours of egocentric videos from 7 different sources (over 4.3M images) and ImageNet to train different-sized vision transformers using Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) on slices of this data. Contrary to inferences from prior work, we find that scaling dataset size and diversity does not improve performance universally (but does so on average). Our largest model, named VC-1, outperforms all prior PVRs on average but does not universally dominate either. Next, we show that task- or domain-specific adaptation of VC-1 leads to substantial gains, with VC-1 (adapted) achieving competitive or superior performance than the best known results on all of the benchmarks in CortexBench. Finally, we present real-world hardware experiments, in which VC-1 and VC-1 (adapted) outperform the strongest pre-existing PVR. Overall, this paper presents no new techniques but a rigorous systematic evaluation, a broad set of findings about PVRs (that in some cases, refute those made in narrow domains in prior work), and open-sourced code and models (that required over 10,000 GPU-hours to train) for the benefit of the research community. 7. <b> From Neural Activations to Concepts: A Survey on Explaining Concepts in Neural Networks </b> Abstract: In this paper, we review recent approaches for explaining concepts in neural networks. Concepts can act as a natural link between learning and reasoning: once the concepts are identified that a neural learning system uses, one can integrate those concepts with a reasoning system for inference or use a reasoning system to act upon them to improve or enhance the learning system. On the other hand, knowledge can not only be extracted from neural networks but concept knowledge can also be inserted into neural network architectures. Since integrating learning and reasoning is at the core of neuro-symbolic AI, the insights gained from this survey can serve as an important step towards realizing neuro-symbolic AI based on explainable concepts. 8. <b> Imagined Value Gradients: Model-Based Policy Optimization with Transferable Latent Dynamics Models </b> Abstract: Humans are masters at quickly learning many complex tasks, relying on an approximate understanding of the dynamics of their environments. In much the same way, we would like our learning agents to quickly adapt to new tasks. In this paper, we explore how model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) can facilitate transfer to new tasks. We develop an algorithm that learns an action-conditional, predictive model of expected future observations, rewards and values from which a policy can be derived by following the gradient of the estimated value along imagined trajectories. We show how robust policy optimization can be achieved in robot manipulation tasks even with approximate models that are learned directly from vision and proprioception. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in a transfer learning scenario, re-using previously learned models on tasks with different reward structures and visual distractors, and show a significant improvement in learning speed compared to strong off-policy baselines. Videos with results can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/ivg-corl19 9. <b> Deep Tracking: Seeing Beyond Seeing Using Recurrent Neural Networks </b> Abstract: This paper presents to the best of our knowledge the first end-to-end object tracking approach which directly maps from raw sensor input to object tracks in sensor space without requiring any feature engineering or system identification in the form of plant or sensor models. Specifically, our system accepts a stream of raw sensor data at one end and, in real-time, produces an estimate of the entire environment state at the output including even occluded objects. We achieve this by framing the problem as a deep learning task and exploit sequence models in the form of recurrent neural networks to learn a mapping from sensor measurements to object tracks. In particular, we propose a learning method based on a form of input dropout which allows learning in an unsupervised manner, only based on raw, occluded sensor data without access to ground-truth annotations. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the task of tracking objects in 2D laser data -- as commonly encountered in robotics applications -- and show that it learns to track many dynamic objects despite occlusions and the presence of sensor noise. 10. <b> Creating Trustworthy LLMs: Dealing with Hallucinations in Healthcare AI </b> Abstract: Large language models have proliferated across multiple domains in as short period of time. There is however hesitation in the medical and healthcare domain towards their adoption because of issues like factuality, coherence, and hallucinations. Give the high stakes nature of healthcare, many researchers have even cautioned against its usage until these issues are resolved. The key to the implementation and deployment of LLMs in healthcare is to make these models trustworthy, transparent (as much possible) and explainable. In this paper we describe the key elements in creating reliable, trustworthy, and unbiased models as a necessary condition for their adoption in healthcare. Specifically we focus on the quantification, validation, and mitigation of hallucinations in the context in healthcare. Lastly, we discuss how the future of LLMs in healthcare may look like. 11. <b> Prompt Evolution for Generative AI: A Classifier-Guided Approach </b> Abstract: Synthesis of digital artifacts conditioned on user prompts has become an important paradigm facilitating an explosion of use cases with generative AI. However, such models often fail to connect the generated outputs and desired target concepts/preferences implied by the prompts. Current research addressing this limitation has largely focused on enhancing the prompts before output generation or improving the model\'s performance up front. In contrast, this paper conceptualizes prompt evolution, imparting evolutionary selection pressure and variation during the generative process to produce multiple outputs that satisfy the target concepts/preferences better. We propose a multi-objective instantiation of this broader idea that uses a multi-label image classifier-guided approach. The predicted labels from the classifiers serve as multiple objectives to optimize, with the aim of producing diversified images that meet user preferences. A novelty of our evolutionary algorithm is that the pre-trained generative model gives us implicit mutation operations, leveraging the model\'s stochastic generative capability to automate the creation of Pareto-optimized images more faithful to user preferences. 12. <b> Analogical Reasoning for Visually Grounded Language Acquisition </b> Abstract: Children acquire language subconsciously by observing the surrounding world and listening to descriptions. They can discover the meaning of words even without explicit language knowledge, and generalize to novel compositions effortlessly. In this paper, we bring this ability to AI, by studying the task of Visually grounded Language Acquisition (VLA). We propose a multimodal transformer model augmented with a novel mechanism for analogical reasoning, which approximates novel compositions by learning semantic mapping and reasoning operations from previously seen compositions. Our proposed method, Analogical Reasoning Transformer Networks (ARTNet), is trained on raw multimedia data (video frames and transcripts), and after observing a set of compositions such as "washing apple" or "cutting carrot", it can generalize and recognize new compositions in new video frames, such as "washing carrot" or "cutting apple". To this end, ARTNet refers to relevant instances in the training data and uses their visual features and captions to establish analogies with the query image. Then it chooses the suitable verb and noun to create a new composition that describes the new image best. Extensive experiments on an instructional video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significantly better generalization capability and recognition accuracy compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. 13. <b> Nahid: AI-based Algorithm for operating fully-automatic surgery </b> Abstract: In this paper, for the first time, a method is presented that can provide a fully automated surgery based on software and computer vision techniques.

## Summarized Using Mistral and Answered US Medical License Exam questions: 

"A 33-year-old woman who was recently involved in a motor vehicle accident presents to a medical clinic for a follow-up visit. She was in the front passenger seat when the vehicle swerved off the road and struck 2 pedestrians. She was restrained by her seatbelt and did not suffer any significant physical injury. Since then she has had 1 outpatient visit and is recovering well. She is here today upon the request of her family members who insist that she has not come to terms with the incident. They have noted that she has significant distress while riding in her car; however, she does not seem particularly worried and she cannot remember many of the details of the accident.

On a mini-mental examination, she scores 27/30.

Which of the following best describes this patient’s condition?"


Based on the description provided, it is possible that the patient may be experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as a motor vehicle accident. Symptoms may include intrusive thoughts or memories, avoidance behaviors, negative changes in mood or cognitive functioning, and hyperarousal symptoms like increased startle response or irritability. Even though the patient did not sustain significant physical injuries and scored well on the mini-mental examination, the fact that she experiences significant distress while riding in her car and struggles to recall details of the accident suggests that PTSD may be a possibility.

However, it is worth noting that there may be other factors contributing to the patient's symptoms, so further evaluation and assessment would be required to determine the underlying cause of her distress.

Santa Monica - Chord progression: Dm - Em - Bm - G
Lyrics: She walks around Santa Monica at three o'clock in the morning
Her hair falls in waves across her face, looking so pretty, oh what a sight
She dreams of living somewhere else
Maybe under neon lights
My favorite place in the whole wide world
Where time stands still and nothing ever hurts
And everything just feels kind of okay
In Santa Monica, California, where I spend my days

Rollin' With the Homies - Chord progression: F - G - Am - C
Lyrics: It's Friday night, I'm rolling with the homies
Got the radio loud and nobody worries 'bout me
It's Saturday morning, we're cruisin', no worries 'bout me
Just chillin', chillin

## Premise - Making a Modification using language and creative intent.

### Prompt:

Replace the code starting at line 188+ which has the word key in it - it has an error of duplicate keys.  Rather than that remove that code, keeping the voting buttons.  For the content which works right now modify the dataset in the program to add three stories to vote for and disassemble these into sentences and create emojis for the high information words in the text.  Provide a code listing of the update which only adds data into the program and removes the duplicate key functionality:    "A 45-year-old man presents with a long history of ulcers on the bottom of his feet....


Which of the following findings would most likely be present in this patient?"

"
A 24-year-old man, an information technology professional, gets himself tested for serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels because he wants to know more about his immunity.
He knows that IgM levels reflect the status of his immunity, based on the internet. 
Although the laboratory report is normal, he consults a physician. 
The physician discusses human immunity and its important components. 
He also tells him that most circulating IgM antibodies in the blood of normal persons are produced by a specific type of B cell, which is present mostly in the peritoneal cavity and in mucosal tissues. 
He also mentions that these cells are components of innate immunity. 
Which of the following types of B cells is the physician referring to?"

# Editing Yggdrasil.
1. Create a link to a github edit page by creating a new file, picking a directory name and slash then filename of README.md which intentionally upper cases the README since that is the most important part of single stroke check in for optimal efficiency.

2. Keep Outputs as MarkDown language which has files ending in the extension of ".md".  We refer to this memory format as "MD" files meaning they are able to be treated as an input and output set as text assets.

# 📥 Ingress vs Egress

1. 📥 Ingress
   - 🌐 External Traffic
      - Incoming traffic from users, clients, or other services outside the network
      - Accessing resources within the network or system (e.g., API, web services)
   - 🔒 Internal Traffic
      - Communication between components within the network or system (e.g., microservices)
      - Typically restricted access for improved security

2. 📤 Egress
   - 🌐 External Traffic
      - Outgoing traffic from the network or system to users, clients, or other services
      - Sending responses or data to external entities
   - 🔒 Internal Traffic
      - Communication between components within the network or system (e.g., microservices)
      - Typically restricted access for improved security
   
For Ingress: Azure Container Apps supports HTTPS and TCP types of ingress.

With HTTPS ingress enabled container apps support TLS, HTTP/1.1 and 2, Websocket, gRPC.  TLS1.2 is used for HTTPS.  Endpoints expose port 80, 443.  80 is redirected to 443.  App accessed on FQDN.  Request timeout is 240 seconds.

# Healthy Brain Aging
https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/HealthyBrainAging


# R Prime:

Certainly! Below is a Python code example using Streamlit to create an emoji button label program that generates prompts. This code includes a button for each mental function (Long Term Memory, Working Memory, etc.) that changes with age. When you press the button, it outputs both a random emoji and a corresponding prompt.

python
Copy code
import streamlit as st
import random

# Define list of emojis and prompts
emoji_list = ["😊", "🤔", "😄", "😎", "👀", "🧠", "💡", "📚"]
prompts_list = [
    "Use 'You' talking to AI in first person.",
    "Pick 3-4 things you would instruct or coach on about proficiency.",
    "Describe the opportunity - I am giving you a chance to __ fix -- X --",
    "Pick your X"
]

# Define list of mental functions that change with age
mental_functions = [
    "Long Term Memory (LTM)",
    "Working Memory",
    "Executive Functioning",
    "Attention to Detail",
    "Multitasking",
    "Processing Speed"
]

st.title("Emoji & Prompt Generator 🧠")

# Text areas to display the outputs
st.write("## Generated Emoji:")
emoji_output = st.empty()
st.write("## Generated Prompt:")
prompt_output = st.empty()

# Loop through each mental function and create a button
for function in mental_functions:
    if st.button(f"Generate for {function}"):
        # Randomly pick an emoji and a prompt
        selected_emoji = random.choice(emoji_list)
        selected_prompt = random.choice(prompts_list)
        
        # Display the selected emoji and prompt
        emoji_output.write(f"{selected_emoji}")
        prompt_output.write(f"{selected_prompt}")
To run this code, save it in a Python file and run it using Streamlit. Each time you click one of the mental function buttons, the program will randomly generate an emoji and a prompt. These will be displayed in text areas labeled "Generated Emoji" and "Generated Prompt".

I hope this serves as a fun and engaging way to interact with the topics of mental functions that change with age!




# If R was previous intput and R Prime is result of transformational inputs that update memory:

Create a streamlit emoji button label program that generates prompts.  Feature output of prompt and emoji label generator into text areas.  Inclusive of mental functions that change with age we have:
Long term memory or LTM
Working Memory
Executive Functioning
Attention to Detail
Multitasking
and Processing Speed
Prompts
Use 'You' talking to AI in first person.
Pick 3 - 4 things you would instruct or coach on about proficiency
Describe the opportunity - I am giving you a chance to __ fix -- X --
Pick your X

Below is a summary of which engines support code known in LLMs shown by a small short example of code for that platform.

# Unity (C#)
```
csharp
Copy code
using UnityEngine;
public class MoveObject : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed = 10.0f;
    void Update()
    {
        float moveHorizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float moveVertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(moveHorizontal, 0.0f, moveVertical);
        transform.Translate(movement * speed * Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```

# Godot Engine (GDScript)
```
gdscript
Copy code
extends KinematicBody2D
var speed = 200
func _physics_process(delta):
    var velocity = Vector2()
    if Input.is_action_pressed('ui_right'):
        velocity.x += 1
    if Input.is_action_pressed('ui_left'):
        velocity.x -= 1
    if Input.is_action_pressed('ui_down'):
        velocity.y += 1
    if Input.is_action_pressed('ui_up'):
        velocity.y -= 1
    velocity = velocity.normalized() * speed
    move_and_slide(velocity)
```

# GameMaker Studio (GML)
```
gml
Copy code
if (keyboard_check(vk_right))
{
    x += 5;
}
if (keyboard_check(vk_left))
{
    x -= 5;
}
```

# Phaser (JavaScript)
Phaser is a framework for 2D game development for the web. Here's a simple example:
```
javascript
Copy code
var game = new Phaser.Game(800, 600, Phaser.AUTO, '', { preload: preload, create: create, update: update });
function preload() { /* load assets here */ }
function create() { /* initialization here */ }
function update() { /* game logic here */ }
```

# Unreal Engine 

```
primarily uses C++ and its visual scripting system called Blueprints, I'll show you a simple example using Blueprints that could be part of an easy game.

Let's say you want to create a basic movement functionality for a character within Unreal Engine using Blueprints:

Create a new Blueprint Class: Select "File" > "New Blueprint Class..." and choose "Character" as the parent class. Name it "SimpleCharacter."

Open the Blueprint Editor: Double-click your new class to open the Blueprint Editor.

Add Movement Input: In the event graph, you'll handle the character's movement by:

Right-click to open the context menu and type "Input Axis" to find the "Input Axis" nodes for horizontal and vertical movement. These could be "InputAxis MoveForward" and "InputAxis MoveRight."
Add "Add Movement Input" nodes for both forward and right movement.
Connect the "Input Axis" nodes to the "Add Movement Input" nodes.
Set the appropriate World Direction for each (e.g., X for forward, Y for right).
Here's a diagram representation of how it might look:

css
Copy code
InputAxis MoveForward ----> Add Movement Input (Direction X)
InputAxis MoveRight    ----> Add Movement Input (Direction Y)
```

# CryEngine

```
CryEngine can be quite complex, but I'll provide an example of a simple component that could be part of a basic game. CryEngine uses C++ for its primary programming, so we'll create a basic entity that responds to player input.

Suppose we want to make an entity that moves forward when the player presses a key. Here's how you might start:

Include Headers:
cpp
Copy code
#include <CryEntitySystem/IEntityClass.h>
#include <CryInput/IInput.h>
Create a Simple Entity Class:
cpp
Copy code
class CSimpleEntity : public IEntityComponent
{
public:
    static void ReflectType(Schematyc::CTypeDesc<CSimpleEntity>& desc)
    {
        desc.SetGUID("{A99A881F-3CFA-4D18-8B83-B6D1E8F40959}"_cry_guid);
    }

    virtual void Initialize() override
    {
        // Register an action to the "move" action map
        gEnv->pInput->AddActionListener(this);
        GetGameObject()->CaptureActions(this);
        GetGameObject()->EnableUpdateSlot(this, 0);
    }

    // Implement the update function, called every frame
    virtual void Update(SEntityUpdateContext& ctx) override
    {
        // Handle logic, such as moving the entity forward
        Vec3 position = GetEntity()->GetPos();
        position += Vec3(0, 0, m_speed * ctx.fFrameTime);
        GetEntity()->SetPos(position);
    }

    virtual bool OnActionTriggered(int actionId, int activationMode, float value) override
    {
        // Handle the "move" action
        if (actionId == eAID_Move)
        {
            m_speed = value * 5.0f; // Set speed based on input value
        }
        return false;
    }

protected:
    float m_speed = 0; // Movement speed
};
Register the Entity:
cpp
Copy code
CryREGISTER_Component(CSimpleEntity);
```

Below is a recurring thought experiment of mine to find easier ways to write and read music in real time.

1. List top ten hit songs by Cypress Hill as numbered markdown outline with emojis.
2. For each song list a chord sheet that shows the chords and lyrics for the song.
3. Use alternating lines of lyrics then chords.  For the alternating lines show them as emojis and the line with either lyric or chord in around 80 characters per line maximum.  
4. For sections like Into, Verse, Chorus, Outro show section titles as a seperate line in markdown table with emojis for section title along with easy to read description.
5. For each song chord sheet, try to make information dense as markdown table so it fits on one page per song.
6. Show emojis around each chord to easily spot it at a glance while playing music.
7. Try to keep all lines in a section together in markdown table to minimize length and maximize keeping whole line of lyric and chords close together vertically.
8. Condense each section into a single markdown table.  Use markdown outline too if it makes the whole lyric line appear in one line.  Do not omit any lyrics!
9. For the markdown table sections include the chords playing as another column.  Boldface whenever chord changes from a previous line to easily see transitions of new chords.
10. Use emojis around the chord transitions to visually see when they come up easily at a glance.  Use different emojis on either side of each chord and be consistent picking Emojis easily recognized as beginning with that letter (E for example would be an egg emoji).

Below are some examples of markdown generated to meet these requirements.

         E              B7
Stole many a man's soul to waste

Verse 2:
E                   B7
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
     E                      B7
Had his moment of doubt and pain
E                      B7
Made damn sure that Pilate
         E                B7
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Chorus:
E                     B7

Killed the czar and his ministers
E                  B7
Anastasia screamed in vain
         E                B7
I rode a tank, held a general's rank

Chorus:
E                     B7

E                          B7
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
     E                    B7
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
E                     B7
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
         E                 B7
When after all, it was you and me

Chorus:
E                     B7
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
E                     B7
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

E                     B7
Just as every cop is a criminal

And all the sinners saints
E                            B7
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
         E                B7
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
E                     B7
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
E                     B7
Have some sympathy, and some taste
E                     B7
Use all your well-learned politesse
         E                B7
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

# HL7 Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA)

The Health Level Seven (HL7) Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) is a standard for structuring patient care documents. This standard allows for more consistent documentation across different healthcare providers and systems.

You can find multiple examples of the implementation of this standard in the [HL7 C-CDA Examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples).

## Document Types

The CCDA standard includes various types of documents. These document types each cover different aspects of a patient's care and history. Here are some of these document types and a brief description of what they represent:

| Document Type   | Description   | Emoji  |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
| [Allergies](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples/tree/master/Allergies) | Documents relating to a patient's known allergies. | 🤧 |
| [Care Team](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples/tree/master/Care%20Team) | Documentation of a patient's care team, including doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers. | 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️ |
| [Encounters](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples/tree/master/Encounters) | Records of a patient's encounters with healthcare providers. | 🏥 |
| [Family History](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples/tree/master/Family%20History) | Information about the health of a patient's family, which can be relevant for understanding a patient's health risks. | 👪 |
| [Functional Status](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples/tree/master/Functional%20Status) | Information about a patient's functional status, including any disabilities or impairments. | 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️ |
| [Goals](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples/tree/master/Goals) | Documentation of a patient's health goals. | 🎯 |
| [Health Concerns](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples/tree/master/Health%20Concerns) | Documents containing information about a patient's health concerns, including any specific issues or conditions the patient is dealing with. | 💔 |
| [Immunizations](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples/tree/master/Immunizations) | Records of a patient's immunizations. | 💉 |
| [Medications](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples/tree/master/Medications) | Documentation of a patient's current and past medications. | 💊 |
| [Problems](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples/tree/master/Problems) | Records of a patient's health problems. | 🤒 |

## Entities

Entities in C-CDA refer to the participants in care delivery and can include organizations, devices, and people. Entities can play different roles and can have different relationships with each other.

For example, an organization (like a hospital) might be the entity responsible for delivering care, while a device (like a pacemaker) might be the entity being used in care delivery. Entities like these are used throughout the C-CDA documents to provide a fuller picture of a patient's care.

For more detailed examples, please refer to the [CCDA Examples Github](https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples).

# Writing a Summary of Benefits:

1. **Understanding a Summary of Benefits**: A Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) or a Summary of Health Benefits and Coverage is essential for understanding covered services, associated costs, and the features of different health plans.

2. **Location of Information in the SBC**: 
    - The name of the provider network for the plan, such as _________, can be found at the top of the page.
    - The financial features like your deductible, co-insurance, and out-of-pocket maximum can be found in the first section.

3. **Office Services Section**: This section provides the costs for services like family physician specialists or convenient care center visits. Costs can be a flat dollar payment (copay) or might require you to pay a negotiated discounted rate (deductible and co-insurance).

4. **Preventive Services**: The SBC details preventive services offered at low or no cost, including immunizations, routine checkups, lab work, well-child checkups, mammograms, and cancer screenings.

5. **Emergency Services**: The SBC outlines costs for using emergency services, including the emergency room, urgent care center, convenient care clinic, and ambulance services.

6. **Diagnostic Services**: The section details costs for diagnostic services like x-rays, MRIs, and blood work at outpatient diagnostic locations. It's important to use in-network labs to avoid out-of-network charges.

7. **Hospital Visits**: The next section shows costs associated with inpatient and outpatient hospital visits, along with ambulatory surgical centers, which are freestanding locations known to help save money for outpatient surgeries.

8. **Mental Health and Substance Dependency Coverage**: This coverage is included in the plan, and the details can be found in the respective section.

9. **Other Services**: Provides information about other services including radiologists, pathologists, anesthesiologists, cardiac rehab, speech therapy, physical therapy, durable medical equipment, home health care, and other skilled nursing services.

10. **Benefit Maximums**: The last part of the summary shares the maximum benefits available for certain services.

# Writing a Patient Summary Statement: A Quick Guide

1. **Understanding Summary Statements:** A one or two-sentence synthesization of a patient's condition, based on your understanding, not just data repetition.
2. **Why Write a Summary Statement:** It encourages reflection, deliberate practice, guides differential diagnosis development, and enhances communication with colleagues.
3. **When to Write a Summary Statement:** Ideally throughout a virtual patient scenario, refining as you gain more information. Make sure to finalize before assessment and planning.
4. **Key Elements of a Summary Statement:** Incorporate significant and relevant features of a patient. 
    - Age
    - Gender
    - Risk factors
    - Key clinical findings
    - Symptoms
    - Test results
    - Physical exam findings
5. **Using Medical Terms:** Use specific medical terms for accurate and concise communication. e.g., use 'hypertension' instead of 'blood pressure of 160 over 100'.
6. **Leveraging Semantic Qualifiers:** These are contrasting and often paired descriptors that offer nuanced understanding of a condition.
    - Onset: Acute vs Chronic
    - Duration or course: Constant vs Intermittent
    - Location: Upper vs Lower, Unilateral vs Bilateral
    - Quality: Hot vs Cold, Liquid vs Solid, Stiff vs Flexible
    - Severity: Severe vs Mild, Increased vs Decreased
7. **Importance of Semantic Qualifiers:** Using these assists in developing the differential diagnosis, as relevant diagnoses for acute vs chronic onset, for instance, are usually very different.
8. **Personalizing Summary Statements:** Including the patient's name in the statement enhances personal connection and comprehension.
9. **Example:** 'Mr. Miller, a 70-year-old man, presents with acute onset of high fever, dyspnea, and productive cough. On physical exam, he is in poor general condition with bilateral crackles.'
10. **Takeaways:** Summary statements are crucial in virtual patient cases for fostering understanding, precision, reflection, and effective communication.

# Thursday June 1st, 2023

The use of LLM AI pipelines like ChatGPT to reason around current context requires the in context learning prompt size of token count totals less than the amount of tokens a particular service can process at a time.  Processing of max tokens for GPT4-32k for instance is 32,000 tokens (which are unqiue word and letter parts that reduce to numeric values aka tokenization).

The 32k tokens then for instance are the mximum a prompt and response can collectively take up so if inputs are totalling 20k and response is 12k it will not error but anything larger on input or output tokens will fail with an error.

For context data sources such as XML this poses a problem because a cut point inside the document would create XML which is no longer well formed so it looses context that may refer to relationships within the document such as nesting and open elements that are many levels deep and span in scope across thousands of pages.

Below are ideas that can allow us to work with in context learning loops with complex data like XML:

1. Use Minify to reduce token volume.
	1. Minify is a technique that removes unneeded white space and filler within an xml document.  
	2. It can reduce a 1300 line XML into 115 lines (**over 10x shrink**) which then would allow lines to be processed as sections.
	3. Example XML Minifier:  https://codebeautify.org/xml-minifier
	4. Example tested:  https://github.com/HL7/C-CDA-Examples/blob/master/Documents/Care%20Plan/Care_Plan.xml
2. Use parsing and search in document to batch out inference queries.  This requires some knowledge about what the standards are for XML schema.
3. A CCDA for innstance has these 9 sections but keep in mind there are 11 different variations of CCDA documents.
4. Different sources of same document type (e.g. XML) can have different implementation guides or interpretations for systems mapping creation of entities and attributes.
	1. ClinicalDocument: The root element of the CCDA document.
	2. Patient: Contains information about the patient such as their name, date of birth, gender, etc.
	3. AllergyIntolerance: Contains information about any allergies or intolerances the patient may have.
	4. Medication: Contains information about any medications the patient is taking, including dosage and frequency.
	5. ProblemConcern: Contains information about any health concerns or problems the patient is experiencing.
	6. Procedure: Contains information about any medical procedures the patient has undergone or is scheduled to undergo.
	7. Result: Contains information about any lab or diagnostic test results.
	8. SocialHistory: Contains information about the patient's social habits and history, such as smoking or alcohol use.
	9. VitalSigns: Contains information about the patient's vital signs, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature.


5. Intelligent chunking methods can be used to sense high information value in source data (like NLTK information score) to locate what parts and sections have key information.
6. A sample of chunking methods is below along with a purge example which removes data we don't care about from the document.
7. While chunking solves the problem of reducing token count per transaction, subdividding it can increase run time if each request is synchronous.
8. Code example which builds a prompt list chopped into parts of equal width (24000 characters which is different than tokens and shown below):

```
import textwrap
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def CompressXML(xml_text):
    root = ET.fromstring(xml_text)
    
    # Iterate over the parent nodes
    for parent in root.iter():
        # For each child of the parent node
        for child in list(parent):
            # Check if the child tag is a string and contains 'Comment'
            if isinstance(child.tag, str) and 'Comment' in child.tag:
                # If it is, remove it
                parent.remove(child)
    
    # Convert the XML back to a string
    xml_string = ET.tostring(root, encoding='unicode', method="xml")
    
    # Split the string into chunks of 24000 or smaller
    xml_chunks = textwrap.wrap(xml_string, width=24000)
    
    return xml_chunks
```


It is worth noting neither of these is a perfect solution.  Breaking it into chunks just means it will take longer to inference (maybe a whole day for one document if synchronous).

We can also use AI to solve the problem by decomposing it into parts.

One part is understanding the potential and actual content per document, then having an ordered intelligent way of choosing which data from document to pair with which prompt.

Example prompts and results shown below which again is not definitive across all document types which can have dramatic variation on implementation.

CCDA record format in health care is used to format patient records.  Describe how to decode this information and find the referenced entity for id root:    <custodian>
        <assignedCustodian>
            <representedCustodianOrganization>
                <id root="2.16.840.1.113883.19.5.99999.6" />

            </representedCustodianOrganization>
        </assignedCustodian>
    </custodian>
ChatGPT
CCDA, or Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture, is a standard for the exchange of clinical health information developed by Health Level Seven International (HL7), a not-for-profit standards developing organization.

CCDA documents are XML files that follow a certain structure. Each element (e.g., custodian, representedCustodianOrganization) represents a different aspect of a patient's clinical history.

In the XML snippet you've provided, an id root is given for the representedCustodianOrganization. This id root is a globally unique identifier known as an Object Identifier (OID). In this case, the OID 2.16.840.1.113883.19.5.99999.6 has been assigned to the represented custodian organization, "Clinic Medical Records Department".

To decode this information and find the referenced entity, you would need access to a lookup service or a registry that provides information about what each OID refers to. The OID registry is a public, searchable database, however the specific registry or database can vary based on the country or specific healthcare system being used. For instance, in the United States, the National Library of Medicine maintains an OID registry.

As the nature of OID is to be globally unique and assigned by authorized bodies, it's likely that 2.16.840.1.113883.19.5.99999.6 refers specifically to the "Clinic Medical Records Department". However, without access to the specific registry that provides information about this OID, the precise entity it refers to can't be conclusively determined.

So, in summary, decoding the CCDA record involves understanding the XML structure, the semantics of the CCDA standard, and being able to lookup identifiers (like OID) in the appropriate registries or databases. The id root attribute in the XML provides a unique identifier that can be used to look up additional information about the referenced entity, in this case the representedCustodianOrganization.

list ccda python libraries top ten in markdown table along with short description on usage to parse a cccd from a large xml to a short summary with just labels and values as a dictionary.
ChatGPT
Sure, let's create a table with a list of the top 10 Python libraries that can be used to parse Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (CCDA) documents. I'll include a short description for each of them. Note that most libraries will need custom code to get the exact output you are describing.

Please note that some of these libraries are not specific to CCDA but can parse XML data, and they can be used to extract information from a CCDA document.

| Library | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Python-CCDA](https://github.com/amida-tech/python-ccda) | A Python library for parsing CCDA documents. |
| [PyDicom](https://pydicom.github.io/) | PyDicom is a Python package specifically for parsing, modifying, and generating DICOM files. DICOM is a standard used in medical imaging which includes a lot of health related information. |
| [Lxml](https://lxml.de/) | A library for processing XML and HTML in the Python language. It can be used for parsing CCDA XML documents. |
| [xml.etree.ElementTree](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html) | ElementTree is a part of Python's standard library and can parse XML data. |
| [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) | Although mainly used for HTML scraping, it can also be used for parsing XML data including CCDA documents. |
| [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict) | This library can convert XML to Python dictionaries, making it easier to work with the data. |
| [untangle](https://github.com/stchris/untangle) | Untangle is a simple library which takes an XML document and returns a Python object which mirrors the nodes and attributes in its structure. |
| [defusedxml](https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/) | This is a library that should be used as a safe replacement for Python's standard XML libraries because it defends against several security holes in the standard libraries. |
| [xmlschema](https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/) | This Python library is for reading and writing XML schemas. It can validate and decode XML documents into Python data and other representations. |
| [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) | With the combination of other XML parsing libraries, you can create dataframes from parsed XML data which might help in processing CCDA documents. |
While the libraries listed above can help with the parsing of XML and CCDA documents, creating a short summary with just labels and values as a dictionary will involve writing some custom code that leverages these libraries. The exact implementation will depend on the structure of the CCDA documents you are dealing with. You'll likely need to iterate over the elements of the document and extract the desired information into a Python dictionary.

Please remember that CCDA documents contain sensitive health information. Any code that handles such data should be written and operated in a manner compliant with all relevant data protection laws and standards.




Describe how to access the OID registry:National Library of Medicine maintains an OID registry



As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, you can access the OID registry managed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) using the following steps:

Navigate to the U.S. National Library of Medicine website.

Locate the 'Services & Resources' or equivalent dropdown menu, and look for the HL7/OID Registry.

Clicking on the HL7/OID Registry link will take you to the registry search page. Here you can search the OID database using various parameters.

In your case, to find the information related to the given OID 2.16.840.1.113883.19.5.99999.6, enter it in the search bar provided and hit the 'Search' button.

The result will provide detailed information about the entity associated with the given OID, including its name, associated organization, and other relevant information.

However, please note that the specific steps might change over time, as website designs and features get updated.

Please also note that not all OIDs might be present in the NLM's OID registry. OID assignments can be made by a variety of organizations worldwide, and some of these might not be registered with the NLM. Therefore, if you do not find the OID in the NLM's registry, you may need to consult other OID registries or contact the organization that issued the CCDA document to get more information.

## The United States - Each State with Zip Code Ranges

https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/Streamlit-ChatGPT


What are the names and representative zip code ranges for all of the states in the united states?  give me a markdown table, with a column that represents emojis of that state around the name to make it a state graphic representing what the state is known for.  Order by state name and bold face two letter state codes.  show as markdown code for markdown tables.


**Request:  Write a streamlit python program** to show markdown from a python list dictionary named Publications and include Beckers and National Library of Medicine review information for facilities in states of Minnesota zip code range 555000-56799.  Give latitude and longitude for top ten large zip code address areas by city that are large for zip code.

**Response:  Here is the Python code** to create a Streamlit app that displays markdown information related to the facilities in Minnesota zip code range 555000-56799:

```

import streamlit as st

# Define the dictionary of publications
publications = {
    "Beckers": "Minnesota hospitals face financial strain amid COVID-19, survey finds.",
    "National Library of Medicine": "Enhancing recovery-oriented care in mental health activities to improve outcomes.",
}

# Define the list of top 10 large zip code address areas by city
zipcodes = [
    {"city": "Minneapolis", "zipcode": "55401", "latitude": 44.98, "longitude": -93.27},
    {"city": "St. Paul", "zipcode": "55101", "latitude": 44.95, "longitude": -93.09},

    {"city": "Blaine", "zipcode": "55434", "latitude": 45.16, "longitude": -93.24},
]

# Define a function to format the markdown based on the dictionary
# and zip code range
def format_markdown():
    markdown_string = "# Facilities in Minnesota Zip Code Range\n\n"
    markdown_string += "The zip codes in the range 555000-56799 include the following facilities:\n\n"

# Fine-Tuning GPT-4 with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

1. **Initial Training**
    - GPT-4 is initially trained on a large corpus of internet text.

```python
# This is a simplified representation. The actual training process is much more complex.
gpt4 = train_on_corpus(corpus)
Prompt Creation
Create a prompt for the model to generate a response.

prompt = "SAT Math Question: If 3x + 2 = 14, what is the value of x?"
Initial Response Generation
The model generates an initial response.

response = gpt4.generate(prompt)
print(response)  # Let's assume it outputs '4'
Collecting Human Feedback
A human evaluates the model's response and provides a comparison ranking if the response is incorrect.

# Here the correct answer is '4', so no feedback is needed in this case.
# If the answer was incorrect, a human would rank it lower compared to the correct answer.
Reinforcement Learning
The model is fine-tuned based on the collected human feedback.

# This is a simplified representation. The actual fine-tuning process is more complex.
gpt4 = fine_tune_model(gpt4, human_feedback)
In-Context Learning Loop
The model continues to learn from the feedback in an iterative loop.

# Iterate this process over multiple prompts and feedback rounds
for i in range(num_iterations):
    prompt = generate_new_prompt()  # This function generates a new question
    response = gpt4.generate(prompt)
    feedback = collect_human_feedback(response)
    gpt4 = fine_tune_model(gpt4, feedback)
This process allows the model to progressively improve its ability to answer questions correctly.

Please note that the Python code snippets are highly simplified and just for illustration. The actual training and fine-tuning processes are much more complex and require considerable computational resources.

# 📥 Ingress vs Egress

1. 📥 Ingress
   - 🌐 External Traffic
      - Incoming traffic from users, clients, or other services outside the network
      - Accessing resources within the network or system (e.g., API, web services)
   - 🔒 Internal Traffic
      - Communication between components within the network or system (e.g., microservices)
      - Typically restricted access for improved security

2. 📤 Egress
   - 🌐 External Traffic
      - Outgoing traffic from the network or system to users, clients, or other services
      - Sending responses or data to external entities
   - 🔒 Internal Traffic
      - Communication between components within the network or system (e.g., microservices)
      - Typically restricted access for improved security
    
For Ingress: Azure Container Apps supports HTTPS and TCP types of ingress.

## ChatGPT - Tasks

description of the standards, covering HL7 v2.x, FHIR, EDI, and others in a markdown table:

Standard	Description	Examples	Libraries
HL7 v2.x	Health Level Seven version 2.x is a widely used messaging standard for exchanging healthcare data between systems. It uses a pipe-and-hat format to transmit messages like patient admissions, orders, and results.	ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer), ORM (Order), ORU (Observation Result)	hl7apy, python-hl7
FHIR	Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources is a modern standard for exchanging healthcare data using RESTful APIs. It defines modular "resources" to represent various healthcare entities, allowing flexibility and interoperability.	Patient, Encounter, Observation, DiagnosticReport, AllergyIntolerance	fhir.resources, fhirclient
EDI 278	Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standard 278 is used for transmitting healthcare service information, like prior authorizations and referrals. It includes two substandards: 278A (Request) and 278N (Response).	278A (Request for Review), 278N (Response to Request for Review)	pyx12, edi3tools
IHE XDS	Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (XDS) is a standard for sharing clinical documents between different healthcare organizations in a secure and interoperable manner.	XDS (Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing), XDS-I (Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing for Imaging)	IHE-XDS-Client, pyxds
LOINC	Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) is a universal code system for identifying laboratory and clinical observations.	LOINC codes (e.g., 2160-0 for Serum Creatinine)	loinc2hpo, loinc-parser
SNOMED CT	Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is a comprehensive and standardized vocabulary for clinical terminology in healthcare.	SNOMED CT codes (e.g., 840539006 for COVID-19)	snomedct, snomed-ct-parser
To read and write observations, CCDs, and other formats using libraries, you can follow these examples:

Observations with HL7 v2.x (ORU message):

import hl7
from hl7apy.parser import parse_message

message = "MSH|^~\&|...|ORU^R01|..."  # Replace with a valid HL7 v2.x message
parsed_message = parse_message(message, validation_level='TOLERANT')

# Read an observation
observation = parsed_message.get_segments('OBX')[0]
value = observation['OBX.5']['OBX.5.1'].value
units = observation['OBX.6']['OBX.6.1'].value

# Write an observation
new_observation = hl7.Segment("OBX")
new_observation.set_fields([
    "OBX",
    "1",
    "NM",
    "2160-0^Serum Creatinine^LN",
    "",
    "1.2",
    "mg/dL",
    "0.6-1.3",
    "N",
    "",
    "F",
    "20210508000000"
])
parsed_message.add_segment(new_observation)

CCDs with Python CDA Library:

from lxml import etree
from python_cda import CDA

xml = """<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ClinicalDocument xmlns="urn:hl7-org:v3">
    <!-- CCD content goes here -->
</ClinicalDocument>"""

# Read CCD
tree = etree.fromstring(xml)
ccd = CDA(tree)

# Access patient information
patient = ccd.record_target.patient_role.patient
given_name = patient.name.given
family_name = patient.name.family

# Access medication section
medications = ccd.component.structured_body.component[0].section.entry

# Write CCD
new_ccd = CDA()
new_ccd.set_element("realmCode", code="US")
new_ccd.set_element("typeId", root="2.16.840.1.113883.1.3", extension="POCD_HD000040")

# Add patient information, medication section, etc. to the new CCD


Observations with FHIR:

from fhir.resources import Observation, Quantity

# Read observation from JSON
json_data = {
  "resourceType": "Observation",
  "status": "final",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://loinc.org",
        "code": "2160-0",
        "display": "Serum Creatinine"
      }
    ]
  },
  "valueQuantity": {
    "value": 1.2,
    "unit": "mg/dL",
    "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
    "code": "mg/dL"
  }
}
observation = Observation(json_data)

# Access observation values
value = observation.valueQuantity.value
units = observation.valueQuantity.unit

# Write observation
new_observation = Observation.construct()
new_observation.status = "final"
new_observation.code = {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "http://loinc.org",
        "code": "2160-0",
        "display": "Serum Creatinine"
      }
    ]
}
new_observation.valueQuantity = Quantity.construct()
new_observation.valueQuantity.value = 1.2
new_observation.valueQuantity.unit = "mg/dL"
new_observation.valueQuantity.system = "http://unitsofmeasure.org"
new_observation.valueQuantity.code = "mg/dL"

Short example with markdown:

**Knee Replacement:** The patient is a 65-year-old male presenting with severe **knee pain** and stiffness in the left knee. The patient's pain has been progressively worsening, and he now experiences difficulty walking and climbing stairs. Physical examination reveals significant **functional impairment** and crepitus during knee flexion. X-ray imaging shows advanced **osteoarthritis** with **joint space narrowing** and **bone-on-bone** contact. There is also evidence of **knee deformity** and **joint degeneration**. The patient has tried conservative management, including physical therapy and medication, without success. Considering the patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings, a total knee replacement is recommended to improve the patient's quality of life and mobility.

**Hip Replacement:** A 70-year-old female patient presents with chronic left **hip pain** and difficulty walking. The patient reports a history of worsening pain over the past two years, with limited response to conservative treatments. Physical examination reveals **limited mobility** and **hip stiffness**. The patient's gait is antalgic, and she is unable to perform a straight leg raise due to pain. X-ray imaging of the left hip joint demonstrates severe **hip osteoarthritis** with significant **joint space narrowing**, **bone-on-bone** contact, and **hip deformity**. Given the patient's debilitating symptoms, **functional impairment**, and failure to respond to conservative treatment, a total hip replacement is recommended to relieve pain and restore function.


Long example with markdown:





**Knee Replacement:** Mr. Johnson, a 65-year-old male, presented to the clinic with a history of worsening left **knee pain** that began about three years ago. The patient has tried multiple conservative treatments, including physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, and corticosteroid injections. However, these treatments provided only temporary relief, and his pain has continued to worsen. The patient now experiences difficulty walking, climbing stairs, and performing daily activities due to the severity of the pain. During the physical examination, Mr. Johnson's left knee joint exhibited significant **functional impairment** with limited range of motion, crepitus during flexion, and a positive McMurray's test. The patient's medical history included obesity and type 2 diabetes, which may have contributed to the **joint degeneration**. Mr. Johnson's pain has affected his quality of life, causing sleep disturbances and difficulty in maintaining an active lifestyle.

Radiographic assessment of the left knee joint revealed advanced **osteoarthritis** with substantial **joint space narrowing**, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation. There was also evidence of **bone-on-bone** contact and **knee deformity** in the form of varus angulation. A series of weight-bearing x-rays were performed, which confirmed the severity of the degenerative changes. Laboratory tests ruled out the presence of an inflammatory condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the lack of response to conservative treatments, Mr. Johnson was referred to an orthopedic surgeon for a total knee replacement evaluation. The surgeon discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and his family. After considering the available options, the patient decided to proceed with the total knee replacement surgery.

The surgery was performed using a medial parapatellar approach, and the patient's knee joint was exposed. The surgeon removed the damaged cartilage and bone, reshaped the remaining bone surfaces, and implanted the prosthetic components. A tourniquet was used during the surgery to minimize blood loss. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. Postoperative x-rays confirmed the correct alignment and positioning of the prosthetic components. Mr. Johnson was started on a multimodal pain management regimen, including acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioid medications as needed for breakthrough pain. The patient was encouraged to participate in early ambulation and range of motion exercises with the assistance of a physical therapist.

During the postoperative period, Mr. Johnson experienced a significant reduction in his **knee pain** and demonstrated progressive improvement in his mobility. He participated in daily physical therapy sessions, focusing on strengthening exercises, gait training, and balance activities. The patient was discharged home after a one-week hospital stay with instructions to continue physical therapy and follow up with the surgeon in two weeks. At the follow-up appointment, Mr. Johnson reported continued improvement in his pain and function. The surgical incision was healing well without signs of infection, and the patient's range of motion was gradually improving. The surgeon recommended continuing physical therapy and gradually increasing activity levels, with the goal of returning to normal daily activities within the next few months. Mr. Johnson expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the surgery and the improvement in his quality of life.

**Knee Replacement:** The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of osteoarthritis in both knees. The left knee has been causing significant **knee pain** (9, 11) and stiffness, making it difficult for the patient to perform daily activities such as walking, climbing stairs, and even sitting for extended periods. The patient has been using a cane for ambulation but now finds it increasingly difficult to bear weight on the left knee. Conservative treatments, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy, have been attempted without significant improvement.

Over the past year, the patient's symptoms have progressively worsened, and he now experiences severe pain even at rest. The **knee stiffness** (74, 76) has also increased, limiting his range of motion and making it challenging to fully extend or bend the knee. The patient's quality of life has been severely impacted by his inability to participate in previously enjoyed activities such as walking the dog, playing golf, and gardening.

On physical examination, the patient exhibits an antalgic gait, favoring the right leg. Palpation of the left knee reveals tenderness along the medial joint line and significant **functional impairment** (134, 138) during active and passive movements. There is noticeable crepitus and **joint degeneration** (150, 152) during knee flexion, with a reduced range of motion. The patient is unable to perform a single leg stance on the left leg due to pain and instability.

Radiographic evaluation, including X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was performed to assess the severity of the patient's knee osteoarthritis. X-ray imaging shows advanced **osteoarthritis** (178, 180) with **joint space narrowing** (181, 183) and **bone-on-bone** (184, 186) contact in the medial compartment of the left knee. There is also evidence of **knee deformity** (190, 192), with varus angulation and subchondral sclerosis.

The patient has tried multiple conservative management approaches, such as physical therapy, activity modification, and medication. Despite these efforts, the patient's symptoms have not improved, and his quality of life continues to decline. Given the severity of the patient's condition and the failure of conservative treatments, surgical intervention is recommended.

A total knee replacement is proposed as the most appropriate treatment option for this patient. The procedure involves removing damaged joint surfaces and replacing them with prosthetic components to restore joint function and alleviate pain. The patient has been informed of the risks and benefits of the surgery, as well as the expected postoperative rehabilitation process.

In conclusion, the patient is a 65-year-old male with severe left knee pain, stiffness, and functional impairment due to advanced osteoarthritis. Radiographic imaging confirms significant joint degeneration, joint space narrowing, bone-on-bone contact, and knee deformity. Conservative treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom relief. A total knee replacement is recommended to improve the patient's quality of life and mobility.

**Hip Replacement:** A 70-year-old female patient presents with a long-standing history of left **hip pain** (9, 11) and difficulty walking. She reports that her symptoms began approximately three years ago and have progressively worsened over time. The patient has tried various conservative treatments, including pain medications, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy, without significant relief. Her mobility has become increasingly limited, affecting her ability to perform daily activities and maintain an active lifestyle.

Physical examination reveals **limited mobility** (49, 51) and **hip stiffness** (52, 54) in the left hip joint, with a reduced range of motion in all planes.

Ilya Sutskever on Scaling : https://youtu.be/SjhIlw3Iffs?list=PLHgX2IExbFotmFeBTpyje1uI22n0GAkXT&t=668
Quote: the takeaway that people have taken from it overstated's case the takeaway that people have is it doesn't matter what you do to scale but that's not exactly true you gotta scale something specific you gotta have something that will be able to benefit from the scale it's a great breakthrough of deep learning is that it provides us with the first ever way of productively using scale and getting something out of it in return

prediction is compression prediction is also a statistical phenomenon yet to predict you eventually need to understand the true underlying process that produce the data to predict the data well to compress it well you need to understand more and more about the world that produce the data as our generative models become extraordinarily good they will have I claim a shocking degree of understanding a shocking degree of understanding of the world and many of its subtleties but it's not just the world it is the world as seen through the lens of text it tries to learn more and more about the world through a projection of the world on the space of text as expressed by human beings on the internet but still this text already expresses

Hallucinations and Learning: Right now these neural networks even charge ability makes things up from time to time and that's something that also greatly limits their usefulness but I'm quite hopeful that by simply improving this subsequent reinforcement learning from Human feedback step we could just teach it to not hallucinate now you could say is it really going to learn my answer is let's find out Feedback loop and that feedback loop is coming from the public chat GPT interface that if it tells me that I want a Pulitzer which unfortunately I I didn't I can tell it that it's wrong and will that train it or create some punishment or reward so that the next time I ask it'll be more accurate the way we do things today is that if we hire people to teach our neural net to behave to teach GPT to behave and right now the manner the precise manner in which they specify the desired behavior is a little bit different but indeed what you described is the way in which teaching is going through like basically be that's the correct way to teach you just interact with it and it sees from your reaction it infers oh that's not what you wanted you are not happy with its output therefore the output was not good and it should do something differently next time so in particular hallucinations come up as one of the bigger issues and we'll see but I think there is a quite a high chance that this approach will be able to address them completely.
