# AutoNLP from Transcripts

AI use in transcript analysis offers the capability to automatically summarize, extract entities, understand and score things like bias and sentiment, and also unlock complex memory enhancement which could keep track of things in context related to what you know or are interested in then to personalize the subject matter in order to help you augment your intelligence.

For this purpose there are five transcripts below.  Goal is to create an AI pipeline that could assist with understanding content in a self supervised fashion just by example.  This is a form of instruction using large language models, Seq2Seq NLP Task, MLM NLP Task, Generators, and Transformers together in an AI Pipeline that breaks apart useful information and commits it to memory for you to review later forming an AI agent that helps you learn what you care about.

Transcripts are titled AutoNLPTranscript-AIinScienceFictionandFuturistVisions referring to the fact that thinking creatively about subject matter of possibilities mixed with reality creates a fertile ground for knowledge engineering.

As much as possible results will be shown as markdown per the tips on Markdown Cheatsheet located here:  https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

# Floating Concrete Docks

In the US a ship SS Anderson was one of the first concrete boats.  A concrete pier or boat will last forever, will always be faithfully stable, can float and can offer optimal crossing from land to sea.  Standing fleet of metal or wood require constant upkeep.  Concrete when floating is the ideal solution.

## Love and Music

One of the struggles in life is loving yourself and feeling that you are deserving.  Complexity and nuance in relationships make you think.

I'm listening and playing music alot daily and these are some of the musicians that I play their songs, melodies, lyrics and all the first time choosing to order them by meaning found while playing.  Musicians that write, sing and perform music inspire me.  These musicians each leave a huge mark on music for all, inspiring millions and billions of people around the world to love and to enjoy music together.

Each song has an appeal in some way across:
1) Lyrics
2) Melody & Voice
3) Music

Here is my "play it next" list with a quick link to each set of lyrics and chords together which you need as a musician to play it right away.  Thankyou musicians for sharing the great beauty of the world.

## Artists of the Day - 6/7/2022
My family/friend Dennis who is 94 stopped by walking the island the other day and brought Sam and I four albums, along with a wish of love.  The artists were Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, John Prine, and Eydie Gorme.  With my daily music challenge of playing at least three songs per day of each artist I am interesting learning to play them first time through this is my list for today.

## General Purpose Languages
W3C Recommendations and HL7 FHIR are the frameworks we use for web languages.	|	https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rdf.html

A key theme in 2022 is Knowledge Representation in AI, Use of NLP to augment and assist language, and Web2 the use of microservices and platform SDKs and frameworks into simplified, high performance tech forward solutions that are loosely coupled and web based.

To be useful for both humans and machines the form of knowledge representation must be terse, meaning it is short and contains everything you would need to understand the text, the fields on what they contain and the structure which maps entities to values for example "Heart" is a part of a "Body".  "Lung" is also part of a "Body".

## RDF
The Resource Description Framework or RDF is a general purpose language for representing language on the web.

RDF is often referred to as a "Triple" language which means it can allow structure to exist consisting of a:
1) Subject
2) Predicate
3) Object

RDF format allows us to bridge operational data exchange and formal knowledge processing to be able to share data easily between humans and machines without loosing structure and without creating cognitive burden allowing the data to be read by humans or machines.

When impedance differences show up it makes it difficult to use a language in both contexts.  To minimize these complications we strive to reconcile the records across time and perspective.  In Health Care it is important to be recording records versus facts for example who did what ("Dr. AllCome diagnosed patient x with COVID19") rather than stating absolute medical facts ("patient x has viral pneumonia").

A simple example in context of Physical Health might be:
Subject	|	Predicate	|	Object
--------|---------------|-------------
<http://health.org/#Heart>  |	<http://health.org/IsPartOf> 	|	<http://health.org/#Body> 
<http://health.org/#Lung>  |	<http://health.org/IsPartOf> 	|	<http://health.org/#Body> 

The triple sequence like a sentence is separated by whitespace and terminated by a period.

RDF Turtle is used in FHIR to be able to round trip serialization patterns between different languages including XML and JSON which are used in web services and web applications.

## Enter the Human!
For human understanding, the ability to be minimal, terse and still maintain structure is key to language.  
For this reason even the above simple example is not reduced to a dense enough structure where it is readily understandable without training.

If we simplified format with Symbols a possible more terse more human understandable format would not loose structure. 

What might that look like?

Option	|	Advantages/Disadvantages	|	Example
--------|---------------|-------------
Markdown	|	Standard	|	https://github.com/topics/markdown
FHIR		|	Standard	|	https://www.hl7.org/fhir/rdf.html
RDF		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/
Dictionary	|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_nested.asp
Sets		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp
Tuples		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp
Lists		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp
Lambda		|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lambda.asp
Variables	|	Standard	|	https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_multiple.asp


e.g. Pipe delimiters are nice yet you cannot read the label easily inline and you loose structure:
BodyParts|Heart|Lung
Colon and semicolons are used within text frequently by humans so delimiters are easily corrupted:
: ;
Programmatic language symbols work well.  But if you mix them it becomes harder for humans to decipher the parts
{, ", = , }, </>
HL7 v2.5.x had it pretty good since once you understood a few symbols it is easier to read..  One limitation tho is labeling becomes overly burdensome however structurally it is terse.
Unicode emojis work well: https://huggingface.co/spaces/awacke1/Emoji-Short-Codes

An RDF like simplification that uses a few symbols might allow for an optimally terse representation that has inline labels for Subject, Predicate, Object

If we want to make it easier to read for humans, we would want to simulate the two types of Memory humans use.
It is worth considering properties of Semantic and Episodic memory since data and knowledge representation exist to communicate and persist to memory what we want to communicate.

## Definitions:

ep·i·sod·ic mem·o·ry
noun	PSYCHOLOGY
a type of long-term memory that involves conscious recollection of previous experiences together with their context in terms of time, place, associated emotions, etc.
"those results suggest that participants were using episodic memory to recall the presented words in all conditions"
a conscious memory of a previous experience.
"the hippocampus is critically involved in forming episodic memories"

se·man·tic mem·o·ry
noun	PSYCHOLOGY
a type of long-term memory involving the capacity to recall words, concepts, or numbers, which is essential for the use and understanding of language.
"if patients lose semantic memory, they struggle with knowledge of everyday objects in the world, and have trouble communicating"
a recollection of a word, concept, or number.
"the extraction of semantic memories and associated emotions"


## Nine properties of Episodic Memory
There are essentially nine properties of episodic memory that collectively distinguish it from other types of memory. Other types of memory may exhibit a few of these properties, but only episodic memory has all nine.  Episodic m

Contain summary records of sensory-perceptual-conceptual-affective processing.
Retain patterns of activation/inhibition over long periods.
Often represented in the form of (visual) images.
They always have a perspective (field or observer).
Represent short time slices of experience.
They are represented on a temporal dimension roughly in order of occurrence.
They are subject to rapid forgetting.
They make autobiographical remembering specific.
They are recollectively experienced when accessed.


## Options for a Terse Knowledge Representation Structure For Easy Understanding

Dictionaries are represented within Python code using a minimal structure similar to RDF.  For example in our RDF example above there are three parts, the Subject, the Predice and the Object.  That plus an ability to compose a list of records delimited by period allows you to represent a list of records that can either be a graph or a list of N dimensions.

A dictionary is ordered changeable and does not allow duplicates and can be represented like this:
Parts = {
  "Body": "Heart",
  "location": "Chest"
}
Nested Dictionaries allow similar representing Health Conditions across People:
UpperAbdomen = {
  "PartofBodyForPerson1" : {
    "Heart" : "Excellent",
    "Lung" : "Excellent"
  },
  "PartofBodyForPerson2" : {
    "Heart" : "Excellent",
    "Lung" : "Excellent"
  }
}

Super simple yet understandable structures can then be optimal yet the constraint would need to be to not allow any symbolic delimiter within data in order to avoid adding the complexity of escape sequences.  So programmatically understanding data as code could be most descriptive and fluid while being advantageous to trade of to succinct terse implementation:

Two liner, self explanatory, expects data does not contain symbols: {":, to keep it simple.
CarExample = {"brand": "Ford",  "model": "Mustang",  "year": 1964}
print(CarExample["brand"])

# Storyteller Myths, Legends, Deities, and Demigods

------------ | -------------
Tengu	|	tengu, in Japanese folklore, a type of mischievous supernatural being, sometimes considered the reincarnated spirit of one who was proud and arrogant in life. Tengu are renowned swordsmen and are said to have taught the military arts to the Minamoto hero Yoshitsune. They live in trees in mountainous areas.
Cernnunos	|	Cernunnos was the Gaelic god of beasts and wild places. Often called the Horned One, Cernunnos was a mediator of man and nature, able to tame predator and prey so they might lie down together. He remains a mysterious deity, as his original mythos has been lost to history.
Samhain	|	It was believed that ringing a bell on Samhain kept away evil spirits. Burying animal bones in front of your house on the night of Samhain will keep evil away, according to some legends of eastern Europe. Samhain is a good time of year to work on communicating with the spirit world.
Elken | In some Pacific Northwest tribes, elk are also considered to be particular protectors of women, and in some legends elk lead women who had been captured by enemy warriors back to their homes. In Plains Indian tribes, elk were associated with masculinity, endurance, and bravery, and elks' eyeteeth were highly valued both as objects of adornment and as the symbol of a man's hunting prowess. In some Plains tribes, men saved the eyeteeth from their first elk kill to make into engagement jewelry for their sweetheart. In others, the number of elk teeth sewn onto a woman's dress showed off the wealth and skill of her husband or father. Elk are associated with coneflowers in some Great Basin tribes, such as the Ute, who refer to coneflowers as "elk root."
Ah Puch	|	Ah Puch is one of the names associated with a god of death in the ancient Mayan religion. He was known as a god of death, darkness, and disaster. But he was also a god of childbirth and beginnings. The Quiche Maya believed that he ruled over Metnal, the underworld and the Yucatec Maya believed that he was just one of the lords of Xibaba, that translates to "place of fear" in the underworld.
Nu Wa	|	Nüwa was the one who patched the holes in Heaven with five colored stones, and she used the legs of a tortoise to mend the pillars. There are many instances of her in literature across China which detail her in creation stories, and today remains a figure important to Chinese culture.

Meaning of Life Symposium (Manolis Kellis):

The beauty of the human genome
Coming up on 50th birthday, get together with friends to discuss the meaning of life
What is the meaning of life?

Meaning of life symposium means - sym (together) posi (drink) so  symposium = drinking party
42 is answer (Hitchikers Guide)

Give seven minute species on meaning of life
	I dont know what the meaning of life is but....
	All mutually synergistic
	Difference between purpose and meaning
	Linguistics Harvard - Very Pythian answer.  Pythia oracle "Answer is become one.  

Like a child become one year old everything new, 
drive yourself to perfection in all your tests, 
when people are separate, come together as one and support eachother.

Why life itself?
	is it inevitable
	about physics
	transcends physics
	distinct entity in universe
	forces, is it another force, lifeforce
	a new software or layer of a computer system

Gratitude
	During this pandemic we worked alot breaking all boundaries of where personal life begins
	Intellectual pleasure in day of exhaustion
	Wow I was useful today, feeling pleasure and grateful today.  
	Thankyou for all you have given me and grant me the strength to give to others the way you have given to me.
	I love this.  Me in most unfiltered way to do something useful and interact with aspects
	Discover aspects of AI, ML .. that nobody has seen before with data we capture which has never been observed
	As a father teaching my kids the understanding they have of world around us and me too
	Unfiltered criticism from a child knows no dishonesty, immense love and passion.
	We as adults learn how to hide so much better
	Raw emotions that make a human being
	To become truly human results.
	Complexity of language grow as more neural networks are connected, frontal cortex forming for 10 years
	Incredible that the knowledge fed throughout shaping neural nets as forming
	Most beautiful thing to do which completes me.
	Decades of compassion, sharing, anger, patience, as a parent you become a very different kind of teacher
	Learning process of sharing, conveying knowledge, encapsulating the complex, and giving bite size chunks society can appreciate.
