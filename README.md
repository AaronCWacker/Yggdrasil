# Storyteller Myths, Legends, Deities, and Demigods
Type | URL
------------ | -------------
Tengu	|	tengu, in Japanese folklore, a type of mischievous supernatural being, sometimes considered the reincarnated spirit of one who was proud and arrogant in life. Tengu are renowned swordsmen and are said to have taught the military arts to the Minamoto hero Yoshitsune. They live in trees in mountainous areas.
Cernnunos	|	Cernunnos was the Gaelic god of beasts and wild places. Often called the Horned One, Cernunnos was a mediator of man and nature, able to tame predator and prey so they might lie down together. He remains a mysterious deity, as his original mythos has been lost to history.
Samhain	|	It was believed that ringing a bell on Samhain kept away evil spirits. Burying animal bones in front of your house on the night of Samhain will keep evil away, according to some legends of eastern Europe. Samhain is a good time of year to work on communicating with the spirit world.
Elken | In some Pacific Northwest tribes, elk are also considered to be particular protectors of women, and in some legends elk lead women who had been captured by enemy warriors back to their homes. In Plains Indian tribes, elk were associated with masculinity, endurance, and bravery, and elks' eyeteeth were highly valued both as objects of adornment and as the symbol of a man's hunting prowess. In some Plains tribes, men saved the eyeteeth from their first elk kill to make into engagement jewelry for their sweetheart. In others, the number of elk teeth sewn onto a woman's dress showed off the wealth and skill of her husband or father. Elk are associated with coneflowers in some Great Basin tribes, such as the Ute, who refer to coneflowers as "elk root."
Ah Puch	|	Ah Puch is one of the names associated with a god of death in the ancient Mayan religion. He was known as a god of death, darkness, and disaster. But he was also a god of childbirth and beginnings. The Quiche Maya believed that he ruled over Metnal, the underworld and the Yucatec Maya believed that he was just one of the lords of Xibaba, that translates to "place of fear" in the underworld.

Meaning of Life Symposium (Manolis Kellis):

The beauty of the human genome
Coming up on 50th birthday, get together with friends to discuss the meaning of life
What is the meaning of life?

Meaning of life symposium means - sym (together) posi (drink) so  symposium = drinking party
42 is answer (Hitchikers Guide)

Give seven minute species on meaning of life
	I dont know what the meaning of life is but....
	All mutually synergistic
	Difference between purpose and meaning
	Linguistics Harvard - Very Pythian answer.  Pythia oracle "Answer is become one.  

Like a child become one year old everything new, 
drive yourself to perfection in all your tests, 
when people are separate, come together as one and support eachother.

Why life itself?
	is it inevitable
	about physics
	transcends physics
	distinct entity in universe
	forces, is it another force, lifeforce
	a new software or layer of a computer system

Gratitude
	During this pandemic we worked alot breaking all boundaries of where personal life begins
	Intellectual pleasure in day of exhaustion
	Wow I was useful today, feeling pleasure and grateful today.  
	Thankyou for all you have given me and grant me the strength to give to others the way you have given to me.
	I love this.  Me in most unfiltered way to do something useful and interact with aspects
	Discover aspects of AI, ML .. that nobody has seen before with data we capture which has never been observed
	As a father teaching my kids the understanding they have of world around us and me too
	Unfiltered criticism from a child knows no dishonesty, immense love and passion.
	We as adults learn how to hide so much better
	Raw emotions that make a human being
	To become truly human results.
	Complexity of language grow as more neural networks are connected, frontal cortex forming for 10 years
	Incredible that the knowledge fed throughout shaping neural nets as forming
	Most beautiful thing to do which completes me.
	Decades of compassion, sharing, anger, patience, as a parent you become a very different kind of teacher
	Learning process of sharing, conveying knowledge, encapsulating the complex, and giving bite size chunks society can appreciate.
