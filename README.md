Meaning of Life Symposium (Manolis Kellis):

The beauty of the human genome
Coming up on 50th birthday, get together with friends to discuss the meaning of life
What is the meaning of life?

Meaning of life symposium means - sym (together) posi (drink) so  symposium = drinking party
42 is answer (Hitchikers Guide)

Give seven minute species on meaning of life
	I dont know what the meaning of life is but....
	All mutually synergistic
	Difference between purpose and meaning
	Linguistics Harvard - Very Pythian answer.  Pythia oracle "Answer is become one.  

Like a child become one year old everything new, 
drive yourself to perfection in all your tests, 
when people are separate, come together as one and support eachother.

Why life itself?
	is it inevitable
	about physics
	transcends physics
	distinct entity in universe
	forces, is it another force, lifeforce
	a new software or layer of a computer system

Gratitude
	During this pandemic we worked alot breaking all boundaries of where personal life begins
	Intellectual pleasure in day of exhaustion
	Wow I was useful today, feeling pleasure and grateful today.  
	Thankyou for all you have given me and grant me the strength to give to others the way you have given to me.
	I love this.  Me in most unfiltered way to do something useful and interact with aspects
	Discover aspects of AI, ML .. that nobody has seen before with data we capture which has never been observed
	As a father teaching my kids the understanding they have of world around us and me too
	Unfiltered criticism from a child knows no dishonesty, immense love and passion.
	We as adults learn how to hide so much better
	Raw emotions that make a human being
	To become truly human results.
	Complexity of language grow as more neural networks are connected, frontal cortex forming for 10 years
	Incredible that the knowledge fed throughout shaping neural nets as forming
	Most beautiful thing to do which completes me.
	Decades of compassion, sharing, anger, patience, as a parent you become a very different kind of teacher
	Learning process of sharing, conveying knowledge, encapsulating the complex, and giving bite size chunks society can appreciate.
