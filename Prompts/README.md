# 1. GPT vs Gemini vs Grok vs Claude (initial random rank order)

## 1. Four Part Battle of Causal LMs

**Prompt**:
Lets define a modern kilt based outfit for Aaron with his upcoming competition at Highland Games:  Scottish Highlanders: Highlanders wore kilts in battle, but these were not armored. Some modern interpretations add leather or metal for a “warrior” aesthetic, though this is ahistorical.   Aaron is doing the Stone Throw, the Shotput 25 lb and the hammer toss.  Itemize each piece of equipment for Aaron's trip across Scotland.  Kit so far is Kilt - Green styled with copper buttons, Long Heathered socks that are knee high plus, Salomon Amphib Bold 2 amphibious shoes green / black, Brooks white heavily padding running trainers with jump heels for offroad running.  Salomon off road running climbing shoes with heavy impact soles, Duck Hunting thigh high boots with waterproof and handles for easy on off for heavy mud and water.  Body Glove black shirt long sleeves.  Knit cap green and yellow.  North face green coat, North Face black and Red Coat.  Provide a markdown outline, emoji and label for easy reading.  Lets organize packing list and bag list with layout for equipment.

## Observations

While all four had a request to return as markdown, none return markdown "Code".
When asked to supply markdown **code** which ones do it properly?
1. GPT had no issues, markdown branches were two level.  Emojis up front are good.  Bold labels.  Consistent indent, breaks, table.  100%
2. Gemini had double issues with emojis - twice and failure to match font showing unknown unicode values not helpful.  Similar to X/Grok mixup with unicode emojis and fonts.  Smart recommendations of items with moderate success.  70%
3. Grok had three sentence intro, multilevel markdown, classification, nested levels.  Emojis at end of line - preference is front.  Will include that in future.  Set based first principles better reasoning structures.  100%
4. Claude had sparse simplistic outline with multi level and emojis.  Optimized for reading and memory.  Lacking a bit in substance and density.  However simplistic rules were closely adhering to ask.  100%
