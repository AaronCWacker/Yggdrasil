# AI Zero to Hero - 3/9/2023

# Multiply your productivity by 100 times today using AI:
  - Lets prove it with  HuggingFace, Gradio, Streamlit, ChatGPT,and HTML/Javascript
  - My Progression:
    1. 2021 - With AI Coding From Scratch **10 AI programs per year** = 1 AI Program per 36.5 days.
    2. 2022 - Discovered HF Spaces.  **200 AI Programs** = a little over .5 Programs per day.
    3. 2023 - New process - **AI Pair Programming** ChatGPT+HF = 266 in Q1 (**1064 programs per year**)
    4. Conclusion: Over 100x with this simple recipe.
    
    ## When focused using AI to write outline, simplify outline, generate examples, debug and curate:
        1. **Record:** 30 working programs in 2 days on planned subject outline. (15/day)
        2. Synopsis: Learning in the Loop - AI Pair programming expands your knowledge.
        3. Use **Targeted AI vocabulary keywords** to generate domain specific code and text mashups.

# Prompt using domain technical knowledge to accelerate process of design and development.
  1. Top Ten Favorite Quick and Easy prompting patterns:
    1. **Markdown** 1,2,3
      1. Prompt: Create a markdown cheat sheet that lists all the commands and short instructions for performing markdown code.
      2. Notice it has trouble with code versus non code due to delimiters like triple apostrophe?  Its using markdown.
      3. Prompt: Show full code listing in markdown code delimited by ``` with no comments
    2. **Mermaid** for sorted and organized graphs.
    3. **Python Streamlit** and Python gradio with code example input.
    4. **Progressions** iterate with prompts to get what you want in a few steps..
      1. **Prompt and Experiment:**  Write an AI program using python, streamlit sklearn and keras to produce an AI program predicting sepal length.
      2. **Curate and Revise:** Show full code listing.  remove commentary.  Make code listing as short as possible with few lines of code
      3. **Reinforce and Teach:** Test and Share with HF to debug and test.  Demonstrate and share links to others.
  2. Why does this work?  Copy and Modify Pattern, Mirroring, and the Human Brain
