Interview Test for Distinguished Engineer - Senior AI/ML Engineer Position
1. Explain the key differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Provide an example use case for each type of learning in the context of AI and ML.
2. How do Transformer models, like GPT and BERT, differ from traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks? Discuss the advantages and limitations of using Transformers for natural language processing tasks.
3. As a senior AI engineer, how would you approach the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained large language model like GPT-4 for a specific NLP task? Please outline the steps you would take and any potential challenges you might face.
4. Explain the concepts of attention and self-attention in the context of Transformer models. How do they contribute to the performance and interpretability of the model?
5. What are the key considerations for designing an AI architecture that scales efficiently, maintains low latency, and minimizes costs? Describe a specific example of a project you have worked on where these considerations were important.
6. When designing and developing a user interface for an AI application using Streamlit or Gradio, what are the key factors to consider in order to provide an effective user experience? Please provide an example of a project where you implemented these principles.
7. What is your approach to evaluating and selecting the most appropriate ML algorithms and frameworks for a given problem? Discuss any trade-offs you might consider and how you would validate the model's performance.
8. How do you ensure ethical AI and ML practices during the development and deployment of AI models? Discuss potential biases, data privacy concerns, and any mitigation strategies you have implemented in your past projects.
9. Can you discuss a challenging AI/ML project you have worked on, focusing on the technical issues you faced and the solutions you employed? How did you collaborate with cross-functional teams to address these challenges?
10. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in AI, ML, and NLP research? Please share an example of a recent research paper or development that you have found particularly interesting and its potential implications for the industry.
