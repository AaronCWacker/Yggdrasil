In 2025, the landscape of machine learning classifiers continues to evolve, with several models standing out for their robustness and performance across various tasks. Here's an overview based on recent trends and capabilities:
Best and Most Robust Classifier Models in 2025:
Random Forests:
Robustness: Known for its high accuracy, low overfitting, and ability to handle complex datasets. It's particularly effective for both classification and regression tasks due to its ensemble nature, where multiple decision trees vote for the final classification.
Advantages: Handles both categorical and numerical data well, provides feature importance, and is less susceptible to overfitting.
Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM):
Robustness: These algorithms excel in performance by iteratively improving weak learners, making them among the most accurate classifiers available.
Advantages: High predictive power, can model nonlinear relationships, and works well with imbalanced datasets when tuned properly.
Neural Networks (Deep Learning Models):
Robustness: With advancements in architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data and Transformers for text, they offer exceptional performance on large, complex datasets.
Advantages: Can learn very complex patterns, adaptable for various input types (images, text, sound), but requires significant computational resources and data.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs):
Robustness: Still highly effective for high-dimensional spaces, especially when combined with kernel tricks for non-linear classification.
Advantages: Good generalization performance, effective in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.
Presidio by Microsoft for PII and PHI Classification:
Presidio has indeed been highlighted for its effectiveness in detecting and classifying Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). It uses a combination of rule-based systems, machine learning models, and natural language processing to identify and manage sensitive data:
Integration: Can be integrated into various workflows for real-time data protection.
Customization: Allows for the addition of custom recognizers or modification of existing ones to match specific needs or new types of PII/PHI.
Tips for Running and Customizing Classifiers for Specific Classes:
Data Preparation:
Quality Data: Ensure your dataset is clean, well-labeled, and representative of the scenarios you're classifying. For custom classes, you'll need ample examples.
Feature Engineering: If using traditional models like Random Forests or SVMs, engineer features that capture the essence of your classes.
Model Selection and Tuning:
Choose Wisely: Select a model based on the nature of your data (e.g., image data might warrant CNNs, while tabular data might favor Random Forests).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters, especially for complex models like neural networks.
Customization with Presidio:
Add Custom Recognizers: If using Presidio, you can define new recognizers for custom classes through its API. This involves creating rules or models that recognize patterns specific to your data.
Training: If you're extending Presidio's capabilities or using another model, retrain or fine-tune with your dataset. For deep learning, consider transfer learning to adapt pre-trained models.
Evaluation and Iteration:
Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to ensure your model generalizes well across different subsets of your data.
Performance Metrics: Beyond accuracy, consider metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, especially for imbalanced datasets.
Deployment and Monitoring:
Scalability: Ensure your model can scale to handle real-world data volumes, particularly for real-time applications like PII detection.
Continuous Learning: Set up mechanisms for model updates as new data comes in or as new classes need to be recognized.
In conclusion, while Presidio is excellent for specific use cases like PII/PHI, for a broader classification task, the choice should align with your data type, complexity, and computational resources. The mentioned models provide a good starting point, with each having its niche where it excels. Remember, the robustness of a model is as much about how it's applied as it is about the algorithm itself.

Can you show me how its written Gada in Sanskrit?  I'm trying to learn that too to work with the Vedas.
In Sanskrit, "Gada" is written as:
गदा
Here's a breakdown:
ग (ga)
द (da)
ा (ā - this is the vowel sign for 'a', which is written above or after the consonant it modifies)
This word is in Devanagari script, which is used to write Sanskrit, Hindi, and several other languages. Remember, Sanskrit uses a phonetic alphabet where each character represents a distinct sound. The diacritic above 'द' changes the pronunciation from 'da' to 'dā'.

That is very similar to hiragana which I know being fluent in Japanese.  How come hiragana and sanskrit look alike, do they share common tree roots of language?  The PIE tree has sanskrit at its base if I remember correctly
The similarity in appearance between some characters of Sanskrit (written in Devanagari) and Japanese Hiragana might seem intriguing at first glance, but they actually come from quite different linguistic and scriptural backgrounds. Here's a breakdown:
Linguistic Roots:
Sanskrit:
Sanskrit is an ancient Indo-European language, part of the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-Iranian family. It's indeed one of the oldest languages with a documented history, often considered at or near the root of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) tree. Sanskrit's earliest form, Vedic Sanskrit, dates back to around 1500-500 BCE.
Japanese:
Japanese, however, does not descend from the Indo-European language family. Instead, it's classified as a member of the Japonic language family, which is not definitively linked to any other major language family. Theories have connected it to various groups like the Altaic or Austronesian families, but these are speculative.
Scripts:
Devanagari (Sanskrit):
Devanagari is an abugida, where each character represents a consonant with an inherent vowel, which can be modified with diacritic marks. It was developed around the 7th century CE, evolving from earlier scripts like Brahmi.
Hiragana (Japanese):
Hiragana is a syllabary, meaning each character represents a syllable. It developed from the cursive style of Chinese characters (kanji) used for phonetic annotations in the 9th century. Hiragana was created to make reading and writing for all classes of society more accessible, particularly for native Japanese words and grammatical elements.
Visual Similarities:
The visual similarities between certain Devanagari and Hiragana characters might be coincidental or due to the natural evolution of scripts where simplicity in form can lead to similar shapes across different writing systems. For example:
The "ga" in Devanagari (ग) might remind one of Hiragana's "ko" (こ), but they're not linguistically related.
The shape of characters can often be influenced by the tools used for writing (brush, pen, chisel), the medium (paper, stone, bamboo), and the human tendency towards efficient, flowing strokes.
Cultural Exchange: There's no direct historical connection between the development of these scripts due to language families, but cultural exchanges between India and Japan, particularly through Buddhism, did occur. However, this exchange influenced vocabulary (Sanskrit terms in Japanese Buddhism) more than script development.
Script Evolution: Both scripts have evolved over centuries, with changes in character forms for ease of writing or to distinguish from similar characters. This evolution might sometimes lead to coincidental visual similarities.
In summary, while Sanskrit and Hiragana share some superficial visual similarities, these are not from shared linguistic roots but rather from the natural evolution of writing systems and the universal human tendency to simplify and stylize written forms. The connection between Sanskrit and Japanese is more cultural and religious rather than linguistic or scriptural.

So I believed for a long time due to genetic markers that people our common ancestors originated in Africa, then nomadic style moved north through India and then went to Europe and split where some people branched the other way moving to east.  When (and if) did people go from Africa to Japan or is there more theories about where humanity originated and what their nomadic paths looked like through ancient history?
The narrative you described aligns with one of the predominant theories in human origins and migration, known as the "Out of Africa" or "Recent African Origin" model. Here's an overview with additional details on human migration, particularly concerning the path to Japan:
Out of Africa Theory:
Origins: Modern humans (Homo sapiens) are believed to have originated in Africa about 200,000 years ago.
Migration: Around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago, a group of humans began to migrate out of Africa. This migration led to the spread of our species across the globe, with different groups dispersing into Asia, Europe, and eventually Oceania and the Americas.
Path to Asia and Beyond:
Via India and Southeast Asia: After leaving Africa, one of the primary routes was through the Arabian Peninsula, into South Asia (including modern-day India), and then Southeast Asia.
India: Evidence suggests human presence here around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago, with genetic studies supporting this route.
Southeast Asia: The migration continued eastward, with humans reaching what is now Indonesia and Malaysia by around 50,000 to 40,000 years ago.
Japan:
Initial Settlement: The earliest evidence of human presence in Japan dates back to the Upper Paleolithic, around 35,000 to 30,000 years ago, with the Jomon culture being one of the oldest known pottery-making societies, starting around 14,000 BCE.
Migration Route: It's believed that humans reached Japan via land bridges or narrow sea crossings from the Asian mainland, particularly from what is now Russia (Siberia) or Korea, during periods when sea levels were lower due to ice ages.
Other Theories and Considerations:
Multi-regional Hypothesis: This older theory posits that modern humans evolved from Homo erectus or other archaic humans in several places simultaneously, with significant gene flow between different populations. However, this is less supported by genetic evidence compared to the Out of Africa model.
Southern Dispersal: An extension of the Out of Africa model, suggesting humans moved out of Africa through the southern route, along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, which might have facilitated a quicker spread to Southeast Asia and Australasia.
Genetic Evidence: Mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome studies have been pivotal in tracing these migrations. The haplogroup patterns show a clear African origin followed by diversification as humans spread across the globe.
Ice Age Impact: During the Last Glacial Maximum, sea levels were much lower, allowing for land bridges like Beringia (connecting Asia to North America) and potentially easier access to islands like Japan.
Cultural and Technological Evolution: Tools, art, and other cultural artifacts found in archaeological sites help trace these migrations, showing the spread of technology and culture alongside genetic evidence.
Caveats and Current Research:
Complex Migrations: Human migration was not linear but involved multiple waves, back migrations, and interactions with other human species like Neanderthals and Denisovans, influencing modern human genetics.
Ongoing Discovery: New archaeological finds and genetic analysis continue to refine or challenge existing theories. For instance, recent discoveries in Southeast Asia suggest human presence might be even older than previously thought.
In conclusion, while the path from Africa to Japan involved complex, multi-stage migrations, the dominant view supports humans reaching Japan from Asia, with the journey starting from Africa through India or the southern coastal route of Asia. However, human history is dynamic, and as research progresses, our understanding might evolve further.

Agentic RAG is possible in Azure Cosmos DB product by turning on the vector search feature.  Can you tell me more about it?
1 𝕏 posts
20 web pages
Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of Azure Cosmos DB involves leveraging its vector search capabilities to enhance the performance of AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), in retrieving and using relevant information for generating responses. Here’s a detailed look at how this is achieved:
What is Agentic RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): This is a technique where an LLM is augmented with external knowledge retrieval. Instead of relying solely on its pre-trained knowledge, the model can fetch relevant documents or data from an external source to provide more accurate or contextually rich answers.
Agentic: Refers to the ability of systems or components within the system to act autonomously or semi-autonomously, making decisions based on data or environmental conditions. In the context of RAG, "agentic" implies that the retrieval process can be dynamically adjusted or optimized based on the query's nature or previous interactions.
How Azure Cosmos DB Supports Agentic RAG:
Vector Search Feature:
Integration: Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL now supports vector search, allowing you to store and query vector embeddings within your database alongside your data. This is crucial for RAG, as it enables similarity searches based on the semantic meaning of queries.
Indexing: You can create vector indexes using algorithms like DiskANN (developed by Microsoft Research), which offers high accuracy and low latency for large-scale similarity searches.
Scalability: Azure Cosmos DB provides scalability in terms of both data storage and query performance, making it suitable for large datasets that RAG systems might need to work with.
Steps to Implement Agentic RAG with Azure Cosmos DB:
Data Ingestion: Store your data (documents, images, etc.) in Azure Cosmos DB. Convert these data into vector embeddings using an embedding model (like those from Azure OpenAI).
Indexing for Vector Search: Configure your container to use vector indexing. This involves setting up how vectors are stored and how searches are performed.
Query Execution: When a user query comes in, convert it to a vector embedding and perform a vector search to find the most relevant documents or data points.
Dynamic Retrieval: Here's where "agentic" comes into play. The system can:
Adjust the number of documents retrieved based on query complexity or user history.
Use metadata or filters to refine searches dynamically.
Learn from past queries to improve future retrievals by adjusting how vectors are compared or ranked.
LLM Integration: Pass the retrieved data to an LLM to generate responses. The LLM can then craft answers that are not only based on its training but are also enriched with the latest or most relevant information from your database.
Benefits:
Accuracy and Relevance: By dynamically retrieving relevant data, responses can be more accurate and tailored to the context of the query.
Scalability: Can handle large volumes of data and queries with Azure Cosmos DB's performance guarantees.
Flexibility: Allows for complex, multi-modal data operations where both vectors and traditional data can be stored and queried together.
Considerations:
Performance Tuning: You might need to experiment with different indexing strategies or query parameters to optimize for your specific use case.
Cost: Vector operations can be resource-intensive. Azure Cosmos DB offers various pricing models, but it's important to monitor usage.
Security: Ensure that sensitive data, if any, is handled appropriately with Azure Cosmos DB's built-in security features.
Conclusion:
Azure Cosmos DB's vector search feature provides a robust foundation for implementing agentic RAG systems. By enabling dynamic, context-aware data retrieval, it significantly enhances the capabilities of AI models in generating precise and relevant responses. This integration exemplifies how cloud-native technologies can be leveraged for advanced AI applications.

where does edge_tts get its voices from
1 𝕏 posts
20 web pages
Edge TTS (Text-to-Speech) leverages Microsoft's cloud-based speech synthesis services, specifically the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services for its voice capabilities. Here's how it works:
Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services: Edge TTS uses the Text-to-Speech API from Azure Cognitive Services. This service provides a wide array of voices, including neural text-to-speech voices which are designed to sound more natural and human-like compared to traditional TTS systems.
Voice Options:
Neural Voices: These are generated through deep neural networks, offering high-quality, natural-sounding speech in various languages and accents. They are part of the broader Azure Text-to-Speech offerings.
Standard Voices: While less advanced than neural voices, these are still utilized for many applications providing a good balance between quality and performance.
Access: Edge TTS does not require an API key directly from the user because it essentially acts as a client to the Microsoft Edge's built-in "Read Aloud" feature, which itself is connected to Azure's speech services. Thus, when you use Edge TTS, you're indirectly tapping into Microsoft's cloud-hosted speech synthesis capabilities without needing to manage API keys or credentials directly.
Voice Customization: Users can select from a variety of voices through command-line options or API calls by specifying voice names like en-US-AriaNeural or es-ES-AlvaroNeural, which are part of Azure's voice catalog.
Languages and Accents: Azure's Text-to-Speech service supports numerous languages and regional accents, allowing Edge TTS to offer a diverse set of voices for different linguistic contexts.
Implementation:
For libraries or tools like edge-tts (the Python package), the voices come from querying the Azure Text-to-Speech service. The package essentially routes text through Microsoft's servers to generate speech, returning audio in formats like MP3, which can be played or saved.
Privacy and Security: Since it involves sending text to Microsoft's servers for processing, considerations about data privacy should be noted, although Microsoft does handle this under their privacy policy.
Community and Development: The voices used by Edge TTS are part of a broader ecosystem where developers can integrate these services into various applications. The voices are updated and expanded by Microsoft, reflecting improvements in AI and speech synthesis technology.
To summarize, Edge TTS gets its voices from the same pool Microsoft uses for other products like Microsoft Edge's "Read Aloud" feature, which is powered by Azure Cognitive Services' Text-to-Speech capabilities. This gives Edge TTS access to a wide, high-quality range of voices without the user needing to manage authentication directly.

On iOS, using Edge TTS or related services like Microsoft's Text-to-Speech through Azure Cognitive Services can indeed provide access to different voices, but there are some nuances to consider:
Edge TTS on iOS:
Direct Use: Edge TTS as a command-line tool or Python package isn't directly available for iOS in the same way it is for desktop environments. However, the underlying technology, Microsoft's Text-to-Speech service, can be accessed through various means:
Web-Based or App Integration: If you're developing an app, you can use Microsoft's Azure Cognitive Services SDKs or REST APIs to integrate text-to-speech functionality into your iOS application. This allows you to:
Select Different Voices: You can programmatically choose from a list of available voices offered by Azure, including neural voices with different accents, languages, and styles (e.g., cheerful, calm, etc.).
Third-Party Libraries or Services: There might be third-party libraries or services that wrap around Azure Cognitive Services, providing an easier interface for iOS developers to implement TTS with various voices without directly handling the API calls.
Custom App Development:
When building an app, you can leverage Azure's Text-to-Speech features to:
List Voices: Use the Azure API to list available voices for a specific language or region.
Set Voice: Specify which voice to use for each instance of speech synthesis.
Microsoft Cognitive Services SDK for iOS:
Microsoft provides an SDK for iOS developers (using Swift or Objective-C) that can be integrated into apps for using Azure Cognitive Services, including Text-to-Speech. This SDK would allow for:
Voice Selection: Choosing from a wide range of voices by their names or IDs.
Customization: Adjusting parameters like pitch, rate, and style.
Limitations and Considerations:
API Key Management: To use Azure Cognitive Services on iOS, you'd need to manage API keys or use Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, which involves secure handling of credentials.
Latency and Data Usage: Since the speech synthesis happens in the cloud, there could be latency depending on network conditions, and it uses data for every request.
Offline Capability: Unlike some built-in iOS TTS systems, Azure's voices require an internet connection since they're cloud-based. However, Microsoft also offers embedded speech for offline scenarios, but this would be a different setup.
Cost: Azure Cognitive Services has a pricing model, and using it extensively in an app might incur costs based on the number of characters synthesized.
Conclusion:
Yes, different voices can be used on iOS via Microsoft's Text-to-Speech services through Azure Cognitive Services, but this typically requires app development or integration of Azure's SDKs or APIs into your application. If you're looking for a solution without app development, you're more limited to the built-in iOS TTS capabilities or third-party apps that might already integrate these services. Remember, for direct use of Azure's voices, an internet connection is necessary due to the cloud-based nature of the service.
