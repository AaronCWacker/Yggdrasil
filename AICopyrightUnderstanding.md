Large language models (LLMs) do not simply memorize and store entire documents verbatim in an internal “copy-paste” format—rather, they statistically encode patterns of the text during training. Here is a breakdown of what that means and why they still must be cautious about reproducing copyrighted text:

Statistical Patterns vs. Direct Storage

How the model “remembers” text. During training, an LLM is shown many examples of text (possibly containing copyrighted or public domain content). The model adjusts its internal parameters (weights) so it can accurately predict the next token (word or subword) given the preceding context.
No verbatim storage of entire documents. These parameters form a highly compressed, abstract encoding of language patterns. They do not contain an indexed, line-by-line database of training data. So even if a model was trained on entire copyrighted books, it does not literally store them in raw textual form.
Why an LLM Must Be Careful With Copyrighted Material

Risk of “verbatim regeneration.” In some rare circumstances—especially if prompted in a certain way—an LLM might reproduce large chunks of text close to its training data, effectively “leaking” what amounts to copyrighted content. This can happen if the statistical patterns align too closely with the prompt and the model inadvertently re-creates the same sequence of tokens that appeared in training.
Legal and ethical obligations. Reproducing copyrighted text verbatim can run afoul of copyright law. Since the model’s creators wish to avoid these legal issues (and respect fair use guidelines), it is restricted from intentionally providing exact blocks of text from copyrighted works, unless it’s a short excerpt allowed by fair use or user-provided content.
Why the Model Can’t “Just Return Anything”

Policy-based constraints. Even if the model might be capable of stringing together tokens that happen to align with copyrighted content, it is subject to usage policies. These policies explicitly instruct the model to refuse or limit sharing large chunks of copyrighted text verbatim.
Statistical generation vs. retrieval. The generative process is more akin to predicting and sampling the next token from a learned probability distribution than “looking up” memorized passages in a library. While partial or approximate quotes may appear, there is no dedicated mechanism to retrieve and hand over huge copyrighted passages as-is.
Implication: The Model Has the “Patterns,” Not an Exact Copy

Compressed knowledge. The model effectively learned broad linguistic and semantic structures, so it does “know” about the content in the sense that it can talk about the themes or gist. But it does not have a simple “string memory” of entire works.
Potential partial leaks. Because the training data is so vast and compressed, overlaps can occur; in certain edge cases, the model may generate extended text close to the original source. Hence the repeated caution about copyrighted content.
In short, saying “I must be careful about reproducing copyrighted material verbatim” does not mean the model has a direct, fully browsable archive of those works. It means the model’s parameters indirectly reflect patterns learned from training texts, and it must guard against unintentionally generating large, verbatim excerpts of that copyrighted text—both for legal reasons and to respect the intellectual property rights of authors.

Lets say tho that you only trained on one document, then it could right?  Its really that you wouldnt want to since it would violate copyright law

Thought about training on a single document for 4 seconds
Indeed, if you trained a model on a single document (especially a shorter one), it becomes more likely—practically guaranteed in trivial cases—that the model’s parameters could faithfully reproduce large swaths of that text, simply because the model can memorize something so small.

However, the crucial distinction is:

Technical capability: From a purely technical standpoint, if the training corpus is small enough, the model may effectively memorize entire passages—especially if it is over-parameterized relative to the size of the corpus. If prompted cleverly, it can “regenerate” the text close to verbatim.

Legal/ethical constraints: Even if the model can reproduce the copyrighted document exactly, there’s still a policy and legal framework preventing (or discouraging) such behavior when that text is not in the public domain. In other words, the model’s capacity to do so does not negate the potential legal ramifications.

Hence, yes: in a small-scale scenario—like training on a single copyrighted document—technology alone does not prevent the model from outputting that text. Instead, enforcement of usage policies is what (in principle) prevents someone from using it to distribute the entire document verbatim.

If a model is producing text that is exactly the same as part of text from copyrighted text, isnt it then breaking the law exccept if it knows its fair use?

I am not a lawyer, but here is a general overview of how copyright law can apply in this situation:

Copyright Protects Against “Unauthorized Reproduction.”

When someone (or something, like a model) reproduces verbatim text from a copyrighted work, that can qualify as infringement if it is done without the copyright owner’s permission and no legal exception (e.g., fair use) applies.
Fair Use (in U.S. Law) or Similar Exceptions Elsewhere.

In some jurisdictions (notably the U.S.), using limited excerpts of copyrighted text for specific purposes—such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, teaching, or research—can qualify as fair use. Whether something is fair use typically depends on a four-factor balancing test:
Purpose and character of the use (e.g., commercial vs. nonprofit, transformative or not).
Nature of the copyrighted work (fact vs. fiction, published vs. unpublished).
Amount and substantiality of the portion used relative to the entire work.
Effect on the market for the original work.
Note that fair use (U.S. law) or “fair dealing” (in some other countries) is context-sensitive. Simply being “short” or “only part of the text” does not guarantee that it is lawful; likewise, sometimes slightly longer passages can still be permissible if they serve a transformative purpose.
Models Don’t “Know” Fair Use Automatically.

Large language models can’t reliably parse all the contextual nuances of fair use by themselves—they only follow heuristics or policy constraints set by their developers. If the system is asked to produce extensive verbatim excerpts, that could be problematic unless it qualifies under an explicit exception like fair use or the text is in the public domain.
Legal vs. Technical Capability.

Even if the model can regurgitate exact text, there are strong reasons (legal and ethical) why it shouldn’t, absent a valid legal rationale. Some model owners implement filters or policy guidelines to minimize the risk of infringing uses.
Bottom Line.

If the model outputs verbatim copyrighted text without a lawful justification, it could be considered copyright infringement. Determining whether it actually is infringement requires analyzing all the circumstances (jurisdiction, purpose, length, nature of the excerpt, etc.).
In a practical sense, yes—it generally is “breaking the law” unless an exception like fair use applies.
