# Languages
We are seeing the beauty of discovery of knowledge locked away in specific languages which cannot be expressed otherwise including emergent symbolic reasoning cross-set reasoning where we have learned globally something unique.  
  As we let go of our US-centric beliefs on KM, and embrace that ML can combine the best symbolic inner thought as a single unicode symbol to represent a neuron, or unit of variation.  
  In my life I have learned Japanese, Cantonese, a bit of Thai, Spanish, German, and Emoji/Unicode symbols with Emojis/Unicode being my  most recent fav akin to Sanskrit root of PIE tree..  
  There are ideas I can express in one language or dialect that dont have pre-knowledge in the others.  
  As we see ASI learn optimal expressions in thinking steps, we are going to learn more than we have ever known by being students of its emergent languages which may be superhuman in organization and evolution of humanity.  
  Thanks for coverage of this. 
  DDS since they used 256 experts its more accommodating of distilling our humanity sum of expertise.

In Ender's Game, I felt the wisdom of understanding empathy with your worst enemy was a great lesson.  
And also resilience when you are misunderstood in languages that are alien to you.  
We will learn advanced organization and mental models that lead to our own hyper-intelligence.  
This may be our next required basic education as we learn how to think as humanity with maximum connected free energy rather than constraining race, creed or country.  
This leads to our organized internal knowledge being level 6 (humanity) up from level 5 (country) the best of humanity and beyond.
