Jordan Peterson states, 
'''You can imagine that the words are surrounded by a cloud.
A cloud of images that they evoke.
The images can be translated into actions.
The greatest writing uses words.
In a manner that profoundly affects perceptioon and action.
I would take the manner in which I act and behave.
Translate that into a set of images.
My dreams do that for me for example.
Then I compress them into words.'''
