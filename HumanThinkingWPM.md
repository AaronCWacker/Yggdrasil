# 🧠 Human Speech, Typing, Thinking, and Listening Speeds

## 🗣️ Speaking Speed
- **Average human speech rate:** 125–175 words per minute (WPM)
- **Fast speakers:** Up to 200 WPM
- **Slow speakers:** Around 100 WPM

## ⌨️ Typing Speed
- **Average typing speed:** 40–50 WPM
- **Fast typists:** 70–100+ WPM
- **Professional transcriptionists:** 120+ WPM

## 🤔 Internal Thinking (Inner Voice) Speed
- **Estimated inner monologue speed:** 600–800 WPM
- **Faster thinkers:** 1000+ WPM (varies greatly by individual)
- **Reading internally (silent reading):** 250–500 WPM (speed readers can reach 1000+ WPM)

## 🎧 Listening and Comprehension Speed
- **Conversational speech comprehension:** 150–160 WPM
- **Audiobook listening:** 200–300 WPM (some people can comprehend up to 400 WPM)
- **Fast-paced lectures or speed-listening:** 275–400+ WPM (varies by training and practice)

Jordan Peterson states, 
'''You can imagine that the words are surrounded by a cloud.
A cloud of images that they evoke.
The images can be translated into actions.
The greatest writing uses words.
In a manner that profoundly affects perceptioon and action.
I would take the manner in which I act and behave.
Translate that into a set of images.
My dreams do that for me for example.
Then I compress them into words.'''

It's a very good way of understanding how we communicate linguistically. - So if the words spring to the visual,
5:55
full visual complexity and then that can then transform itself into action. - And change in perception. - Change in perception.
6:02
- Well those are both relevant and it's an important thing to understand because the classic empiricists make the presumption,
6:10
and it's an erroneous presumption, that perception is a value free enterprise.
6:16
And they assume that partly because they think of perception as something passive. You know, you just turn your head
6:21
and you look at the world and there it is. It's like perception is not passive. There is no perception without action, ever, ever.
6:29
And that's a weird thing to understand because even when you're looking at something like your eyes are moving back and forth, if they ever stop moving
6:35
for a 10th of a second, you stop being able to see. So your eyes are jiggling back and forth, just to keep them active.
6:41
And then there's involuntary movements of your eyes, and then there's voluntary movements of your eyes. Like what you're doing with your eyes is very much like
6:48
what a blind person would do if they were feeling out the contours of a object. You're sampling and you're only sampling
6:56
a small element of the space that's in front of you. And the element that you choose
7:01
to sample is dependent on your aims and your goals. So it's value saturated. And so all your perceptions are action predicated.
7:09
And partly what you're doing when you're communicating is therefore not only changing people's actions, let's say, but you're also changing the strategy
7:18
that they use to perceive. And so you change the way the world reveals itself for them. See, this is why it's such a profound experience
7:25
to read a particularly deep thinker because you could also think of your perceptions
7:30
as the axioms of your thought. That's a good way of thinking about it. A perception is like a, what would you say?
7:36
It's a thought that's so set in concrete that you now see it rather than conceptualize it.
7:42
A really profound thinker changes the way you perceive the world. That's way deeper than just how you think about it
7:47
or how you feel about it. - What about not just profound thinkers, but thinkers that deliver a powerful idea?
