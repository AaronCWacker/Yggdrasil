The film opens with a team of sentients  inspecting a modal within The Matrix.  
0:46
The captain of the Mnemosyne, named Bugs, goes in  and finds herself in a simulation of Trinity being  
0:51
found by the Agents, although it isn’t the same  Trinity as before. She goes through the motions  
0:54
of fighting off the Agents, while Bugs follows and  observes alongside the Mnemosyne’s operator, Seq.  
1:04
Just as the Agents appear to corner Trinity, Bugs  observes that this isn’t what originally happened,  
1:09
and Seq knows it’s a trap. Bugs is then pursued by the Agents,  
1:14
running into an old apartment building.  The lead Agent catches up to her,  
1:19
and they realize they are in the apartment  of Thomas Anderson also known as Neo.  
1:24
Bugs tells the Agent that she knows Neo is  alive, despite others believing him to be dead,  
1:29
because she remembers being stuck in a dead-end  window-washing job when she witnessed Neo in his  
1:33
true form stepping over the side of a building  and not falling, and when he looked at her,  
1:38
it unlocked her mind. The Agent also acknowledges  that he had seen codes in windows and mirrors  
1:44
before he realized he was in a simulation,  and the Agent reveals himself to be Morpheus.  
1:50
Bugs present the blue and red pills for Morpheus  to make his choice, and he takes the red one.  
1:56
They try to escape through various doors, only for  the Agents to be around every corner after them.  
2:02
The two make their exit by jumping out a window. In The Matrix, Neo is living as Thomas,  
2:08
working for the video game company Deus Machina,  where he turned the original story of The Matrix  
2:13
into a successful video game trilogy based  on his memories that he perceived as dreams.  
2:19
His coworker Jude takes him to the local  coffee shop where Neo sees Trinity.  
2:24
He appears to show interest in her, but when Jude  approaches her to be Neo’s wingman, they learn she  
2:29
is now known as Tiffany and is married to a guy  named Chad and has two sons, Brandon and Donnie.  
2:35
At work, Neo finds an intruder in his game,  but they are purged quickly. He is called  
2:41
to meet with his business partner, Smith, a  reborn form of his nemesis within The Matrix.  
2:48
Smith tells Neo that their  parent company, Warner Bros,  
2:51
wants to make a sequel to the Matrix trilogy,  implying that they are being forced to do this.  
2:57
Neo then goes to see his therapist, “The  Analyst”. They discuss a previous suicide attempt,  
3:03
which was the moment Bugs saw Neo stepping  over the side of the building. The Analyst also  
3:09
gives Neo a prescription of the blue pills. Neo and his teammates meet with their boss,  
3:15
Gwyn de Vere, as they all begin work on their  next Matrix story. Neo goes day-by-day feeling a  
3:21
sense of deja vu with everyone expressing their  interpretations of The Matrix and its themes.  
3:27
Later on, Neo returns to the coffee shop where  he talks to Trinity. She mentions having seen  
3:33
her sons play the Matrix video games, and she  thought the Trinity character resembled her.  
3:39
The offices of Deus Machina are being evacuated,  but Neo receives a message to go to the bathroom.  
3:45
He meets Morpheus in there, and he offers Neo the  red and blue pills. Neo starts to freak out over  
3:52
realizing his dreams were real, but Agents begin  to open fire, prompting Morpheus to shoot back.  
3:58
A gunfight ensues, with Smith picking up a gun  and yelling out “MR. ANDERSON!” to Neo. After a  
4:05
tense moment where Smith holds Neo at gunpoint,  Neo finds himself back in The Analyst’s office.  
4:12
He continues trying to convince Neo  that nothing he experienced was real.  
4:17
At night, Neo gets drunk and prepares to  “fly” as he once did, only to be pulled back  
4:22
by Bugs. She tells him that Jude is a sinister  program meant to keep an eye on him, and she  
4:27
convinces Neo to follow her. They go through  a door that takes them onto a train with Seq,  
4:33
and they proceed until they encounter Morpheus,  along with Bugs’ other crew members Lexy and Berg.  
4:39
They show Neo images from the game, which are  just the memories from his original journey  
4:44
with Morpheus in his original form. Bugs tells Neo  that 60 years have passed since the war with the  
4:50
machines, and Neo’s true form that the rest of the  world sees is that of an elderly man. Neo takes  
4:57
the red pill and sticks his hand through a mirror  where The Analyst sees him and starts to panic.  
5:02
While he appears to try and pull Neo through to  convince him he’s just having a psychotic break,  
5:07
the crew is attacked by Agents, leading to  another gunfight that forces them to run.  
5:12
The crew runs back onto the train, where  the passenger bots are corrupted into  
5:16
“swarm mode” to attack Neo and the others.  After the crew fights and kills the bots,  
5:22
Bugs pushes Neo through a small mirror in  order for him to be extracted from The Matrix.  
5:28
He wakes up in a slimy pod-like before, and he  is pulled out by two machines that the Mnemosyne  
5:33
crew uses called Cybebe and Octacles, who are  loyal to the humans. As they fly him away,  
5:39
Neo finds Trinity in the other pod. He  is flown through the ruins of Zion before  
5:44
being taken to the crew’s sanctuary in Io,  where he is hooked up to The Construct.  
5:50
Morpheus tells Neo that he is going through  withdrawals from what The Matrix has been feeding  
5:54
him, with low odds for survival, but Morpheus has  confidence in him. Neo is put in a dojo simulation  
6:01
where Morpheus has them spar against each other,  with Neo getting knocked down repeatedly until  
6:06
he believes in himself again and uses his power to  send Morpheus flying out and destroying the dojo.  
6:13
Neo reawakens in the sanctuary, where  Bugs formally introduces him to the crew,  
6:17
along with their doctor Ellster, who is the  granddaughter of Neo’s former ally Captain Roland.  
6:23
When Neo asks about Trinity, Bugs says they  don’t quite know yet how to extract her.  
6:29
The crew travels with their pilot Hanno  to meet with the now elderly Niobe.  
6:34
She is angry at the crew for going  against her orders in looking for Neo,  
6:38
but she is still pleasantly surprised to see  him. After dismissing the crew, Niobe talks  
6:43
to Neo about how he gave her hope for a world  without war. She introduces him to their head  
6:49
botanist Freya and digitologist Quillion to show  that they have advanced past what Zion used to be.  
6:55
Niobe also informs Neo of the Oracle  telling them of a new power rising.  
7:00
Until they understand what is really going on,  Niobe has Neo kept in a tower for the time being.  
7:07
The Mnemosyne crew gets Neo from the tower, and  they observe Trinity as she is still “Tiffany”  
7:12
in The Matrix. In an attempt to free her, the  crew re-enters The Matrix and enters a rundown  
7:18
warehouse. There, they find Smith, who comes with  Exiles or rogue programs that come in snarling at  
7:24
Neo and the crew, including The Merovingian, now  reduced to an angry hermit. The crew battles the  
7:31
Exiles, with Neo utilizing his past fighting  skills before engaging in a fight with Smith in  
7:36
a lower level of the building. Smith brutally  beats Neo and tells him he won’t be a servant  
7:42
to the higher power any longer. Neo regains his  strength and sends Smith flying across the room.  
7:49
Neo eventually locates Trinity. She talks  about a dream she had of people chasing them  
7:55
with him riding with her on her Ducati. It is then  revealed that the mastermind behind the new power  
8:01
in The Matrix is The Analyst. He succeeded The  Architect and used the machines to resurrect Neo  
8:07
and Trinity after their deaths during the previous  war. He originally only wanted to bring Neo  
8:13
back but realized that it would only work with  Trinity there with him due to their strong bond.  
8:18
He has created a balance for the two of them  to be close, but not too close, so they don’t  
8:23
overpower his system. The Analyst uses a bot to  go into swarm mode to fire a bullet at Trinity  
8:29
in slow-motion as a threat to Neo to return  to his pod before The Matrix can be rebooted,  
8:35
which Neo attempts to catch, but The Analyst  simply removes it before it hits Trinity.  
8:40
Neo has to flee along with the crew. The crew returns to an infuriated Niobe to  
8:46
prepare for a court-martial. Bugs argue with her  that she cares little about their goals to free  
8:51
human minds. A bird-like machine, Kujaku, arrives  with a message. Niobe brings Neo to meet Sati,  
9:00
who was originally a little girl exile  program he met in “Revolutions” past movie.  
9:06
Shen then tells him that she has been shadowing  him in The Matrix when he was still Thomas.  
9:11
She says that her father designed the resurrection  pods that brought Neo and Trinity back to life.  
9:17
Despite knowing the risks in rescuing Trinity,  
9:20
Niobe agrees to allow the crew  to go along with the mission.  
9:23
The crew carries out the mission, with Morpheus  and Bugs working on Trinity’s pod while Neo goes  
9:28
back into The Matrix to find her at the coffee  shop. He speaks to The Analyst, saying that if  
9:34
Trinity chooses to leave The Matrix, he must let  her go, otherwise, Neo will willingly return to  
9:40
his pod, and The Analyst agrees. Trinity arrives  and talks to Neo, saying that she played his game  
9:47
and recognized the images as her own memories. Her  husband and kids arrive to try and get her out,  
9:53
but Trinity snaps out of it and declares she  hates the name Tiffany and is officially Trinity.  
9:59
She and Neo battle the Agents and overpower them  once they bond. The Analyst is met by Smith,  
10:05
who fights him after declaring himself free,  and he briefly forms an alliance with Neo and  
10:10
Trinity to allow them to escape by shooting The  Analyst and temporarily incapacitating him.  
10:17
Seq detects trouble in The Matrix, so Neo and  Trinity ride through the city on her motorcycle,  
10:22
just like in her dream. The Analyst regains power  and starts using bots to divebomb down onto the  
10:28
streets to take out the heroes. Neo and Trinity  make it to a roof where two choppers fire at them,  
10:34
but Neo uses his power to deflect  a missile and take out one chopper.  
10:39
Trinity then tells Neo that she remembers  everything about them and their relationship.  
10:44
The two leap off the building together in an  attempt to fly, but only Trinity holds that  
10:49
power and hangs onto Neo as they get away.  They are extracted and reunited for good.  
10:56
Neo and Trinity locate The Analyst in his  apartment, where Trinity gives him a few good  
11:01
punches for his manipulations. They threaten him  if he tries to take control of The Matrix again,  
11:07
and they fly away together to  restore balance to The Matrix.
