List all wineries in the midwest for these states: Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and other states considered Midwest. List name, address, any other info you have. Go for maximum winery count. Show asn outline with emojis.


I'd be happy to provide a list of wineries in the Midwest states you mentioned, as well as other states typically considered part of the Midwest region. However, I want to note that creating a comprehensive list of all wineries in these states would be quite extensive and may exceed the length limitations of a single response. Additionally, my knowledge cutoff is April 2024, so some information may not be up to date.

I'll start with an outline of the Midwest states and provide examples of wineries in each. If you'd like more detailed information about a specific state or winery, please let me know, and I can focus on that in a follow-up response.

expand to contain at least 30 per state, and change format to output csv list of records in markdown outline numbered


I understand you'd like an expanded list with at least 30 wineries per state, formatted as a CSV list within a markdown outline. I'll do my best to provide this information, but please note that for some states, especially those with fewer wineries, reaching 30 may not be possible without potentially including outdated or inaccurate information. I'll aim to provide as many verified wineries as I can for each state.

Also, given the large amount of data requested, I'll need to break this down into multiple responses. I'll start with Minnesota and work through the states you specified, then move on to the additional Midwest states. Please let me know when you're ready for me to continue with the next state.

Let's begin with Minnesota:
